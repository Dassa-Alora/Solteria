# Welcome to Solteria   

This campaign will be a high/epic fantasy campaign located within the world of **Solteria (soul-tear-ee-a)**. Solteria has two explored continents, **Nuryu (new-rye-u)** and **Syrelion (sigh-reel-e-on)**, and one unexplored continent, **Xugrera (zoo-gre-raw)**. It is a highly world diverse world full of different races, creatures, religions, guilds, and more. 

## Continents and Countries

### Nuryu

Nuryu is the northernmost and largest explored continent of Solteria. It consists of the following eight countries. 

* The Istrarian (Is-trey-re-an) Dynasty
* Kreslavia (Cree-slaw-ve-a)
* Myrland (Mire-land)
* Ocumiel (Oc-u-meal)
* Rylia (Rye-lee-a)
* The Hiano (High-an-oh)
* The Volquiria (Vole-q-we-ra) Kingdom 
* The Zuzan (Zoo-san) Empire 

### Syrelion 

Syrelion is the southern continent of Solteria. It consists of the following five countries.

* Aholux (Ah-ho-lew)
* Kraytian (Cray-tee-on)
* The Laisora (lay-sore-a) Republic
* Segalla (Sea-gal-la)
* The Shezian (She-see-n) Domain

### Xugrera

Xugrera is the northern most continent in Solteria. It has yet to be explored. Many expeditions have attempted to scale its seemingly infinite high cliffs to survey the continent. However, none have yet to successful climb the treacherous cliffs. Despite this inability to survey the interior of Xugrera, the coasts of Xugrera has been mapped in detail.  

## Water Features

### The Shrouded Deep

The Shrouded Deep is considered to be the deepest ocean as well as one of the most mysterious places in Solteria. A continuous blanket of fog, known as the Shroud, sits unmoving twenty miles off the western coasts of Nuryu, Syrelion, and Xugrera. It is said that the Shrouded Deep is home to horrifying creatures beyond all imagination and any ships who enters the Shroud are never heard from again. 

Due to the Shroud obscuring the skies off the western coasts of Nuryu, Syrelion, and Xugrera the weather is nearly impossible to predict. As an example, a dangerous hurricane could be making landfall on the coastal areas and the inhabitants who live there would not known it was coming until the storm emerges from the Shroud twenty miles off the coasts. Thus, many traders and merchants travel by road instead of by ships. Only those who are weathered sailors dare to sail a Shrouded Run.

### The Endless Ocean

The Endless Ocean is the largest ocean in the world. Many expeditions had gone out to explore and survey the Endless Ocean but none have yet circumnavigate Solteria. The majority of expeditions that attempted to circumnavigate either disappeared or were force to turn back to port due to the dwindling supplies.

There is a commonly known Point of No Return among the sailors known as Leviathan's End, an island that is in the shape of a Leviathan.
