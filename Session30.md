# Session 30

## Oratig

Once Wan-Tao finished telling everyone Xi-Tao's story, Oratig became extremely angry that Xi-Tao put his and his family's lives in danger. Xi-Tao tearful told Oratig that he put all the counterfeit stuff near the back so that they wouldn't use it anytime soon, but Oratig was having none of that. 

Oratig attempted to get to Xi-Tao, but Wan-Tao stopped him. Jean asked Oratig if he would have done the same thing Xi-Tao did to protect his kids. Oratig said that didn't happen and there were no point in having"what if" arguments. Jean said that he'll go over to the Omnipharmacron and see how Oratig would react if he threatened his family.

That riled Oratig up even more and he attempted to fight Jean, but rolled a 1 and face planted on the carpet. Oratig then said angrily that Xi-Tao should at least serve time for thief and then left.

## Drift and Queen Ceana

Queen Ceana asked Drift what his opinion was and Drift says that the law of the kingdom says that the boy must serve 5 years in juvenile prison. Queen Ceana said no and that she won't allow it. 

Drift then told her that this is her first international incident and that what she will decide what to do next will define her rule. Queen Ceana said that she needs to think and asked if she could go to the Nightclaw Inn for some hot cocoa. Drift said of course, but after she makes a decision they must leave for Baolanach immediately. Drift and Queen Ceana then exited the mayor's office.

## Smuggling Thought 

Katrin told the party that they're going to discuss what to do with Xi-Tao at dinner and that you all were welcome to stay and rest in the rooms upstairs. 

Before going upstairs to rest, the party ran downstairs to catch up with Queen Ceana and Drift. You all mentioned to Drift that the Crows of the Midnight Suns are doing "business" in Elagdias and they might be able to smuggle Drift and the Queen out of Elagdias without anyone noticing. 

Drift was absolutely disgusted by the thought of having a criminal organization being anywhere near the Queen. The Queen of course overhead the conversation and like any eight year old child began to ask questions. Drift told the Queen that we'll talk about it when we get to the Nightclaw Inn. The party then said goodbye and went back upstairs to take a long rest at the Lord Mayor's Manor.
