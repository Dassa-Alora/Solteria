# Session 21

## Omnipharmacon 

The party along with the help of Amalia does a detailed inventory of the Omnipharmacon. Jean was assigned to check out the glassware, Eeddi and Garak were tasked with taking count of all the alchemy equipment, and Mellerel was assigned to check and weigh each alchemical ingredient to make sure nothing was missing. 

During the couple hours of taking inventory, the party indeed find that ingredients were missing and some equipment were replaced by very convincing counterfeits. Jean found 15 alchemical glassware that was definitely not OSHA certified. Together, Garak and Eeddi found a total of 10 counterfeit alchemy equipment. Amalia and Mellerel found out that 4 of the alchemy ingredients were off by weight. 

Amalia said that whoever the theft was that they stole what equates to an entire alchemy set and that the 4 missing ingredients could be used to make illusionary spells such as invisibility or silence. 


## Additional investigation checks

After doing inventory, the party decided to check the room one more time to see if they missed anything else. Jean found a child sized coat that was covered in dry mud as well as an identical clean coat. 

Garak and Mellerel investigated the back door to the inventory room. Both of them noticed that the latch part of the door knob and frame had been completely replaced. They also noticed that part of the door frame had been replaced and expertly painted to blend in with the older door frame wood. 

Eeddi began to investigate the shelves of the alchemy equipment and ingredients. She noticed that the dust patterns on the shelves indicated that someone kept moving the counterfeit glassware and equipment back so that the family would be using the legitimate equipment and glassware first. 

Amalia gathered up all the counterfeit glassware and equipment in a wooden box. She also wrote and stamped her seal on a letter to Lord Mayor Katrin about the break in and burglary. She asked the party if they can deliver the evidence and the letter to Katrin. The party said that they're happy to do that and Amalia rewarded the party with 2 potions of healing. 

## Baby Kipp

When the party leaves the inventory room, Amalia went back to helping her 2 older children, Rimloth and Ohana, with the massive order of healing potions for the Murchadha Lumber Mill. As the party headed out of the store, they encounter Sister Amata from the Elagdias Church. She was watching the family's 3 younger children and baby Kipp who were in the playpen. 

Amata approached Mellerel and told her and the rest of the party that they found a family for Kipp in Baolanach, the Capital of Myrland. Amata told the party that Priestess Abigail received the raven that they sent early this morning. Priestess Abigail then messaged Father Varan that she had the perfect family for Baby Kipp. 

Baby Kipp and Sister Amata are going to follow the king's funeral precession and Countess Bellindana's Big Top down to Baolanach. Baby Kipp will be adopted by two Dwarves who were having trouble to conceive. 

Sister Amata handed Mellerel the contact information for Baby Kipp's new family so that Mellerel can keep up with how Kipp is doing if she so chooses to. The party said good bye to Baby Kipp and headed towards Lord Mayor Katrin's manor.

## Lord Mayor Katrin's Manor

The party leaves the Omnipharmacon and notice that there was a noticeable increase in Murchadha Lumber guards throughout the town of Elagdias. As they approach the manor the party notices that there's about 10 guards guarding the entrance of the manor. 

The party argued a bit with the head guard and eventually the party showed the letter to the head guard. The head guard saw that Amalia's seal was legitimate and ordered an annoying guard name Jenkins to lead the party to Lord Mayor Katrin's office. 

Once the party arrived at Katrin's office, they entered and saw Countess Bellindana, Elise, Orilee, Katrin, and Oratig all standing around Katrin's office desk. Countess Bellindana was demanding the mayor to find Baron Murchadha so she can give him a "final act". Katrin claimed that Baron escaped and they haven't found him yet. 

Countess Bellindana then demanded that Katrin give her some guards to help look for Baron. Katrin was like whatever and order the Murchadha Lumber guards to make sure Countess Bellindana doesn't kill anyone. Jenkins and the other two guards saluted enthusiastically and said yes ma'am!

Jenkins, the guards, and Countess Bellindana left Lord Mayor Katrin's office. Katrin ordered the door to be closed so they can all talk quietly.
