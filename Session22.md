# Session 22

## Lord Mayor Katrin's Manor

The party as well as Oratig, Elise, and Orilee talk to Katrin about what's going on in Elagdias. Oratig is insisting that they request some investigators from the Myrland Investigation Bureau (MIB) as well as getting an attachment of MIB watchmen for Elagdias instead of having a private militia in charge of security. 

Lord Mayor Katrin told Katrin that there's no need for that and that it would be better to keep this as a private Elagdias matter. Oratig kept insisting that she do something about this matter and she said that she will and that if he wants to go ahead and get his MIB watchmen here's the application. Lord Mayor Katrin then handed Oratig a giant folder that was full of all the paperwork to request an attachment of MIB watchmen. Oratig looked at the folder with shock and took it. He then walked out the door. 

Lord Mayor Katrin then turned her attention to Orilee and Elise. She asked both girls if they broke Baron Murchadha out of the manor. Orilee said no and she seemed to be telling the truth. Elise said no, but seemed to be very nervous. 

Katrin then said that she may not be fully in charge of this town, but she does have many eyes and ears in Elagdias. She told Orilee that she knows for the past five years Baron has been running a contraband ring for the loggers at his family's mill and that Baron is a member of the Crows of the Midnight Sun crime syndicate. She told Orilee that she hasn't busted Baron because his contraband ring helps retain the loggers at the mill and that increases the town population, which increases the money that the town gets from taxes and the crown. Orilee once again said that she has no idea where her little brother is and that she had no involvement with Baron running off. 

Katrin then turned her attention to Elise. She told Elise that she and Baron have been lovers for the past two years and that she was rather distressed when they brought Baron in for questioning and being placed on basically house arrest. Elise insisted that she didn't help Baron escaped and successful managed to deceive Katrin, but not Orilee. 

Katrin then dismissed the two girls. Elise got up relived and began to walk out of Katrin's office. Elise started walking quickly and Orilee kept pace. Eeddi said that she needed to go to the restroom and followed Elise and Orilee. By the time Elise and Orilee got to the front door of the manor Orilee was practically chasing after Elise. 

## Eeddi

Eeddi followed the strange looks of the guards and was able to find Orilee intimidating Elise in a alley between houses. Orilee has a super high perception and caught Eeddi hiding behind a trash can meowing like a cat. 

Orilee asked Eeddi what she was doing and Eeddi told her that she thought they were racing and that she had the urge to race with them. Orilee was not buying it and asked Eeddi what she wanted. Eeddi then said that she wanted to help Elise and Orilee to prove Baron's innocence. 

## Badges 

The party continued to talk to the mayor about how they could the situation. Katrin explained that she doesn't think Baron is involved in any of the pranks, but that running off looks really bad for him. The party offered their services to prove Baron's innocence and bring the pranksters to justice. 

Katrin accepted their help and gave them card-stock badges with her wax seal on it. She said that she'll write a letter that lets the party into places that they typically aren't allowed to be. She tells the party to come back in an hour or so to get the letter. The party then left to find Eeddi. 

## Questioning Orilee and Elise

The party caught up with Eeddi, Orilee, and Elise. They told Elise that they're trying to help Baron and need to know where he is. Orilee and the party managed to convince Elise to take them to Baron by telling her that they know he's innocent of being the one doing the pranks. 

Elise agreed to take them to Baron and everyone headed into the Gogashire Woods. After walking for a good hour, Elise stopped and told everyone that they should probably hide because he might panic and run off with a large group just walking up to him. 

Orilee insisted on going with Elise since he's her little brother, but the rest of the party agreed to hide. Mellerel attempted to hide without going into a dark place, but she wasn't doing that well. Orilee sighed in disappointment and just told Mellerel to come with her and Elise. Orilee, Elise, and Mellerel then approached the forest cleaning where Baron was hiding. 

## Baron

Elise called for Baron and he came out of his hiding place. Orilee walked up to her younger brother and hugged him. Baron then asked what Mellerel was doing here. Orilee told Baron that she and her friends want to help him. Elise told the rest of the party to come out. 

The rest of the party came out of hiding and asked Baron what was happening and if the gang he was in was involved in the pranks. Baron insisted that he and the Crows of the Midnight Sun had nothing to do with the pranks. He is only a contraband dealer and has ever been dealing with alcohol, drugs, and stuff like chocolate, playing cards, etc. 

The party asked how his shady s*** works and Baron began to explain how his stuff works. He says that he doesn't meet with anyone directly and that he drops a portion of the money that he made as well as some luxury goods from the area in the hole and come back the next day to find that his money and goods have been taken and new stuff to sell was in the hole.

The group asked if he ever dealt with anyone directly from the gang and Baron claimed that he didn't. They asked to see this hole and Baron said sure. Baron led them to a bush and uncovered forest roughage to revel what was essentially a manhole. 

Baron picked up a small pebble and waved it over the manhole. The manhole opened up automatically and revealed a six foot deep circular hole with a bag at the bottom of it. Baron told the group that was his stuff and that it was mostly cash and some bottles of wine from the Dhemay Winery. 

Garak climbed down into the hole and asked Baron if anyone ever contacts him and Baron insisted that he has never seen anyone asides from when he got contacted 5 years ago to start the contraband ring. Eeddi checked to see if there was anything magic about the hole, but the only thing that seemed to be magical was the pebble that Baron used to open the manhole and the manhole's latch. 

After Baron had told them no and that he never met anyone asides from being first contacted, there was a whoosh and a Simic suddenly teleported into the hole standing next to Garak. The Simic asked who Garak was and looked up at Baron to see his face full of shock. The Simic asked Baron (Pocket Crow) if these were new recruits and climbed up out of the hole. 

The Simic, who Baron had called Sly Crow, began to explain how Midnight Crow didn't like what was happening in Elagdias with the pranksters and him running off. Sly Crow then explained that in this situation they can transfer him to a different location or cut him lose. He also told Baron that they can't afford to lose business in the North and that they need to get someone to continue to run the contraband ring. 

Baron begged Sly Crow not to cut him lose and that he has nothing to do with any of the pranks. Jean asked how Sly Crow knew about what happened last night and he responded that we have some dealers in Bellindana's Big Top. Jean suggested that Sly Crow should ask his carnie dealers to fill in for Baron while the party works on clearing Baron's name. 

Sly Crow said that he can do that though they're leaving tomorrow so Baron has until tomorrow morning to decide on if he wants to transfer to another location where the gang operates or get cut loose. Sly Crow then headed off towards the direction of Elagdias. 

## Xi-Tao and Gage suspected

Baron told the group that he really doesn't want to get cut loose. They asked what getting cut loose entailed. Baron told the group that they will alter his memory where he'll forget he has ever been in the Crows of the Midnight Sun gang. But it's risky and a lot of times people would loose random memories and he doesn't want to loose any memories because he doesn't want to forget Elise. 

Baron then began to tell the group that he has nothing to do with the pranks and that he's pretty sure Xi-Tao and Gage are the culprits. Orilee and Eeddi were super doubtful about the accusations as they both hate each other and that there had been numerous incidents where the Murchadha Lumber Mill guards had to step in to stop them from harming each other. 

Elise said that she agrees with Baron and that they both have seen Gage and Xi-Tao head into the Gogashire Woods when her and Baron were heading out of the forest. The party asked about what time Gage and Xi-Tao head into the forest and what direction they headed. Baron said that he and Elise saw Gage and Xi-Tao head into the forest between midnight and 2 in the morning. They then told the party that they head in what seems to be a northeasterly direction. 

## The plan

Mellerel and Jean gave Elise and Baron some camping equipment and told the couple that it would be best if they lay low for a couple of days while they figure this all out. Orilee said that she'll go back into town and pick up some food supplies for them and come back during the carnival. 

The party decided to go back into town to pick up the letter warrant from the mayor. The party was then going to go to Countess Bellindana's Big Top and investigate the carnival. After the carnival, the party was going to follow Xi-Tao and Gage into the forest.
