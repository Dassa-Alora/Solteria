# Session 6 (Short Arc) #

The party once again found themselves in combat at the All Faiths Church in Woodsford, Rylia. You all had went to the dining room and started to fight against the zombies that were trapped in the kitchen area.

## Kitchen Encounter
 
The group managed to defeat the zombies via barbaqueing the zombies as well as some additional skewering. One you guys finished barbaqueing you all begin to search around the kitchen and dining room to find food for you new little addition. You noticed that the food on the table was rotting and that the corpses had been gnawed on. On each of the bodies, you find them wearing either a Enubus, the goddess of peace, necklace or Dyius, god of birth and renewal, necklace. Using detect magic ritualistically style, Eeddi saw that each of the necklaces had a light blue light glimmering from the celestial word on the back of each of the necklaces. You guys also found a human male and a elven female that is believed to be the half-elf baby boy's parents as evident by the same family photograph.     

As you guys go into the kitchen, you found food fit for a baby and the little guy was soon snoozing in Mellerel's baby bjourn due to a food coma. As you all began to investigate the kitchen you noticed some weird stuff going on. The food seems to have been rotting for days if not weeks, whereas back in the library it had appeared that the fire had burnt itself out only eight hours ago. Eeddi suddenly notice a small green light coming from the magical ice box.

Eeddi struggled getting the small compartment on the side of the ice box unlocked and had to call Garak over to her, who had been staring intently at the liver seeing if the liver would rot on the table. Garak unlocked the small compartment on the side of the ice box and opened it. Inside was a red crystal that was crack glowing with green magical light. Eeddi suddenly remember that these ice boxes are made by a guild called The Tinkerers of Tinkerville Trinkets. The Tinkerers of Tinkerville Trinkets are one of the two largest guilds that provides furniture and appliances for every Solterian's needs. Their competitors are the Advanced Furniture and Appliances Affiliate (AFAA). 

It was also discovered by using carrots and a middle age man's alcoholic liver that the crystal had not only cracked, but became tainted with chronomancy magic. After a few more minutes of investigating the dining and kitchen area, the crew decided to further investigate the other rooms.

## Living quarters encounters

The first room that our party came to was basically a mirrored of the other side of the hall that was explored previously. The only difference was that instead of a crib there was a pet bed on the ground full of fleshy fur stuff. The party carefully entered the room and investigated the area. Inside the chest, they found numerous sweaters for a small animal with the name Mamba written on it. Jean tried to get the Mr Goopy goop animal to come to him, but the pet just shuddered and made goopy noises.

The party then decided to leave to poor creature and head into the other room which was the green priest apprentice room. They searched the area and found a copper chalice with silver inlaid in it. You also found a weird jug that started to ooze green gas out. Thankfully, the party managed to cork the jug before anything happened.

## The Sphere encounter

After thoroughly investigating the living area of the basement, the party decided to take the only staircase leading downstairs. As the party continued down the stairs, they began to hear what sounded like electrical humming. You all continued down the stairs and came to a locked door. Garak managed to unlock the door after Eeddi was unable to and the party opened the room. The room was full of various crates, barrels, and boxes as well as the source of the electrical humming, a large monochromatic 10 foot radius sphere floating inches above the ground.

Unsure what to do about the weird sphere, Garak decided that the best thing to do is to throw a dart at the sphere exclaiming that he does not like the sphere. The sphere exclaimed by that it did not like Garak via emitting a flash of blinding white light. And the party wakes up!
