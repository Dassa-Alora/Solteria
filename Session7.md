# Session 7 #

The party awakes to find that they had been dreaming and start their day at different locations in and around Elagdias.

## Elraina ##

Elraina awakens to find herself in a guest room in the Lord Mayor of Elagdias Katrin's manor. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, and a young human teenage girl name Elise (the servant assigned to Elraina), asked if she needed any help for getting ready for the day. Elraina declined the offer and Elise told her that breakfast was ready downstairs. Elise then headed downstairs while Elraina got ready. 

When she excited the bedroom, she found herself in a beautiful hallway with the walls painted with waves and palm trees as well as decorated with paintings of sea life. Elraina headed downstairs and came to a the manor's foyer where numerous ocean specimens, rocks, and shells laid out in a museum like exhibit. In the middle of the "museum" was a very beautiful aquarium full of Hello Fishy memomrable as well as a large rotten yet alive octopus. 

As Elraina stared at the clearly unhealthy, yet happy octopus, Lord Mayor Katrin walked out of the dining room with a plastic bag full of dead and rotting fish. She commented about how she's glad that Walter has taken a liking to Elraina. Katrin then offered Elraina the opportunity to feed Walter his breakfast. Elraina took Katrin up on the offer and attempted to throw a dead and rotten smelly fish into Walter's tank. Unfortunately, Elraina wasn't able to get over the smell and the goopyness of the rotten fish that she was holding and missed throwing to dead fish into Walter's aquarium. The fish instead hit the glass of the aquarium and began to slowly slide down. Fortunately, Walter is an octopus and was able to using one of his rotting tentacles to grab the fish from the outside of the tank.

After that, Katrin led Elraina into the dining room where she was greeted by Elise as well as Lord Mayor Katrin's young son, Daniel. During breakfast, Katrin talked about how excited she was for the Celebration of Life Royal Precession of King Thomas MacSual as well as Countess Bellindana's Big Top arrival this evening. Katrin tried to get her son Daniel excited, but Daniel told his mother that he would rather be rock hunting. 

## Eeddi ##

Eeddi woke up on what essentially was a workbench in Brightpicker's (a Goliath) shop. Brightpicker's dream is to turn his repair shop into a full toys store. Brightpicker had contracted Eeddi in hopes of having more time to work on crafting toys for children. As their day started, Brightpicker showed Eeddi what was essentially a wooden train set that he made after he closed up his shop. While Brightpicker were showing her that, a very angry elven frat boy named Aron Murchada came stomping into to yell at them how they suck at repairing anything and that one of the many saw components that they had fix the other day broke down. 

Brightpicker examined the component and realized that who ever had operated it had used it in correctly. Although Aron insisted that it was Brightpicker and Eeddi's fault for not repairing it correctly. Eeddi offered to follow Aron to the Murchada Lumber Mill to fix the saw and make sure everything was in order while suggesting to Brightpicker that he can continue working on his toys. Brightpicker told her thanks for volunteering to go with Aron and that he'll buy her some ale if the Murchadas don't tip her again. 

Eeddi then followed Aron out of the shop while Brightpicker started to repair the numerous appliances and trinkets that the people of Elagdias requested him to repair. 

## Steve ##

Steve awoke to find himself laying in one of the many hammocks within one of the many logger living quarters at the Murchada Lumber Mill. As he tried to get his bearings, Steve got hit in the back by a different occupant of a hammock next to him and his logger friend Rick asked if he was awake. Steve and Rick then got up and stood in line at the food cart waiting to get breakfast. While standing in line Steve as Rick if he can put his bone watch into Rick's coffee. Rick said no and that Steve was a strange guy. 

After the two loggers got their breakfast, they sat down at one of the many campfires in the courtyard of the mill. Steve told Rick all about how the dream he had last night with Jean, Elraina, Eeddi, Mellerel, and Baby Alkey. Rick told Steve that it wasn't the weirdest dream he heard. Rick then began to described how when he was young he had a dream that he was floating in some kind of plane and a winged creature impaled Rick with a snake like creature. The horn for the start of the work day sounded and Rick went out to the forest with his logging team while Steve headed over to the backside of the mill to start debarking. 

## Jean and Mellerel ##

Jean was happily sound asleep when he suddenly heard a baby crying. Mellerel woke up to see that five month old baby Alkey was still in the baby bjorn lying on Mellerel. The baby was stinky so Mellerel quickly got up and began to change the baby's diaper. While she was doing that, an elven woman name Trishana walked up to Mellerel's tent and began asking questions like "is there a baby in there? why do you have a baby?"

Mellerel finished changing the baby's diaper and walked out of her tent to be greeted by a small party of street performers that still had the financial means to continue following the Celebration of Life Royal Precession of King Thomas MacSual. The street performers were an elven woman named Trishana who was a pipe player, human twin teenagers Matt and Sara (both magicians), and a deaf/mute Aarokroa drummer name Scora.

Jean and Mellerel decided that the best way to explain how they got baby Alkey was to tell them the truth. So the two began to tell Trishana, Matt, Sara, and Scora all about the dream that they had. Obviously, the street performers didn't believe them and thought that maybe someone had abandoned the half-elf baby in hopes of having a better life with their troupe. At this, Matt and Trishana began to devise a plan on how to incorporated a five month old baby into their act tonight. Meanwhile, Sara had offered to care for the baby and Mellerel was all too happy to give the baby to her.

Sara was able to feed the baby grits and was able to easily calm the little guy down. After Sara, Jean, Mellerel, and Scora shut Matt and Trishana's idea of having the baby be part of the show, Scora suggested that they can always take the baby to the church in town. After what happened to Jean and Mellerel during the dream last night, they were dead set against baby Alkey going to a church. Sara then corrected Jean that the baby's name is actually Kipp.

After a few more minutes of discussion, Jean and Mellerel decided that it would be best to go into town to see if a nice, loving family would be willing to adopt baby Kipp. Sara then told Jean and Mellerel that they also need to buy winter swaddle clothes for Kipp because these swaddle clothes and blankets aren't going to cute it for winter. Just as Jean and Mellerel were about to leave Scora signed that he needed more drumsticks and asked if they can get him more drumsticks while they were in town. Jean smartly replied if he wanted to get bird drumsticks for Scora to which Scora threw a drumstick at Jean's facing knocking Jean flat on the snowy ground saying that it looks like this. Jean and Mellerel then headed into Elagdias.
