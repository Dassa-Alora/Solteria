## Notable Locations

### The Heaven's Spires

Acting as a geographical buffer between Myrland and the Istrarian Dynasty is a mountain range known as the Heaven's Spires. Despite the fact that the mountain range itself isn't too long, the Heaven's Spires is the tallest mountain range in all of Solteria. The Heaven's Spires follow the entire border of Myrland and all but a small part of the Rylia's southeastern border.

The Heaven's Spires are pretty desolate and have a harsh climate, thus there are not many inhabitants in the area. There are a few Goliath and Dragonborn clans that wander the lower altitudes of the Heaven's Spires. But asides from them, the Heaven's Spires is very bleak and barren place  

### The Rosgana Foothills

The Rosgana Foothill is an area where the elevation quickly climbs towards the Heaven's Spires. The terrain is fairly rugged with some forested areas dotted throughout the Rosgana Foothills. Some lumber camps have been established on the Foothills, but due to the extremely winter weather and rocky terrain, it is not financially feasible to exploit the few forests that dotted the landscape. 

Despite the weather and harsh terrain, the Rosgana Foothills have numerous tribes and clans that have successfully make a life for themselves herding Giant Snow Capybaras and Yakarak through the area and selling their furs and meat to numerous outposts and towns along the boundary of the Rosgana Foothills and the Gogashire Woods. 

### The Gogashire Woods

The Gogashire Woods is a coniferous forest located at the base of the Rosgana Foothills. It is the only forest within Myrland that is considered profitable. Historical records indicate that Myrland used to be a heavily forested country. However, due to the lumber being in constant high demand and extremely profitable, Myrland has experienced massive deforestation over the past few hundred years. 

The Gogashire Woods are home to numerous towns and villages where people live all year round, including the town of Elagdias. During the winter, the nomads from the Rosgana Foothills and the Heaven's Spire make camp at the edge of the Gogashire Woods. This has caused much strife the people of the towns and villages within the Gogashire Woods rely on the resources that are within the forest, such as animals for food and clothing, lumber for firewood, and other necessities needed to survive the cold winters. As a result many towns within the Gogashire Woods forbid these nomads from entering despite the fact that these tribes and clans tend to sell meat and fur too the residents of the Gogashire Woods during the winter.
