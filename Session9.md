## The Murchadha Lumber Mill ##

Last week on Solteria, the party mostly came together. Steve approached Eeddi and asked "Have you ever had a dream about saving babies and consuming a fire roasted undead man's liver of questionable quality?" Eeddi responded with "No, but I dreamed that you were teaching me how to open doors!" As Eeddi and Steve began to talk about the dream they both had, the two heard the sound of a baby cooing loudly. 

Eeddi and Steve walked out of the lumber mill to see Jean, Mellerel, and baby Kipp beyond the fence that separated the lumber mill and the rest of the town. 

Eeddi, Steve, Jean, and Mellerel began to discuss the dream and why some stuff spawn out of their dream such as baby Kipp, 3rd level spell scroll, 1" by 1" Cube, but not other stuff such as robes, the Solteria scriptures, ect. 

As they were talking, Steve began to tell the group about what happened to the loggers of Team 44. Steve told the group that, a few days ago, a lumber team, Team 44, sat up Lumber Camp 44 a few hours southeast of Elagdias. As they just began cutting trees down, Lumber Camp 44 was consumed by a gigantic fungi network. A logger, Brent, managed to escape and tell the Murchadha guards what had happened. A group of guards went to investigate. 

As they came to the location of Camp 44, the fungi had created a "wall" around Lumber Camp 44. They tried to hack their way through to get to the loggers, but the fungi repaired itself. The guards manage to use torches to break some of the fungi apart and venture about 30 feet into what appeared to be a maze of fungi. The guards manage to find and recover an extremely decomposed corpse of a logger, but asides from the disintegrating logging clothing, they were unable to identify who the logger was. 

Realizing that magical fire would probably be needed in order to enter the fungi maze to recover the rest of the loggers, the Murchadha family sent a raven to a wizard that lives in the region named Friston to request his aid. Unfortunately, they have yet to hear anything back from Friston. 

Meanwhile, the guards have quarantine the area to prevent the fungi from spreading and from curious individuals as well as the loggers families from investigating it. 

Steve then theorized that since some stuff spawn from the dream they had that maybe the fungi spawn into the material plane just like how Kipp spawn into the material plane from their dream. 

As the four were talking, a guard from the lumber mill told Steve to get back to work. Since the guard was pretty apathetic about his job, he went back to "patrolling" the mill. Shortly after, the group met a teenage girl who was all like "look at the cute little baby". The girl asked if she could draw Mellerel's baby and Mellerel was all like "uh sure". 

While she was drawing, the girl began to tell the group how her wish is to go to university and learn more about art. She explained how she doesn't have enough money for university and that the university no longer has the resources for accepting art students since the AAA (Advance Anglers Affiliate) have been taking talent away from the university. 

After the girl finished the sketch, she gave the picture to Mellerel. The group was very impressed with her drawing. The girl thanked them for the compliment and told them that even though she can't go to university, she's able to get practice by doing portraits and drawings for Lord Mayor Katrin. 

The girl then inquiry about Mellerel's baby. Jean then proceeded to recount the dream that they had and how baby Kipp was spawned from the dream. The girl thoroughly enjoyed Jean's magical storytelling, and promptly forgot that she had asked how the party acquired the baby. Anyway, the group asked if anyone would be interested in adopting the baby. The girl told them that she doesn't know anyone, but that you can always drop the baby at the Elagdias Church with Father Varan. Churches are safe havens and the priests and priestesses of the Solteria Pantheon try very hard to place any children brought there with a family instead of being sent to an orphanage. The girl then said goodbye and headed out to sketch some more. 

After that, the guard that had told Steve to get back to work came up to Steve and was all like "come on man get back to work". Steve managed to convince him to let him and the rest of the party to ask the priest of the Elagdias Church about the weird devouring mushrooms. The guard, not wanting to work or enforce anything, was like "yeah sure whatever".  The party then headed off to the Elagdias Church. 

## The Elagdias Church ##

The party arrived at the Elagdias Church which is reminiscent of a small town chapel. It was clear by the construction of the chapel on the outside that the Elagdias Church's primary deity was Rogbium, the god of forests. The church was open and they walked into the church to met a teenage Leonin girl who was clearly an apprentice and sweeping up the church. She asked them how she can help them. 

The party began to tell the apprentice about the dream that they had. Jean then told the girl about their dream via a magical storytelling performance. She thoroughly enjoyed the story. She then explained how sometimes the gods and goddesses send visions like that as a warning and how at times that they would even gift those who have visions with items that the had on their person in the visions. Though she never heard of them gifting people with a baby and she's not convinced that someone didn't just dropped the baby off and your subconscious just included the baby in the dream. 

Eeddi then showed the girl the 1" by 1" magic cube. The girl said that it looks like a magical focus of some sort and told her that it's emitting evocation magic. Steve then began to explain about he thinks that the weird devouring mushrooms may have spawn from another plane just like the items they found in the dream spawned into reality. The girl told them that she doesn't know too much about the other planes, but that Father Varan may know something. 

The girl then went to get Father Varan. A minute later a Firblog walked out of the church office. Father Varan asked how he can help them. The group then explained about their dream and about how Steve thinks that the mushrooms are from another plane. Father Varan said that could be possible. But he believes that perhaps the chaotic neutral deity Grelasis, goddess of wild nature (sorry got the wrong deity last night) were angry at the loggers for disrespecting nature in someway and cursed them with devouring mushrooms. Father Varan then explained how they sent a raven to a wizard name Friston to exorcise Lumber Camp 44, but they haven't heard back from him.

The conversation then turned to how they needed to find a home for baby Kipp. Father Varan then explained how all of the churches of the Solteria Pantheon are safe havens and children could be taken there if the bio parents are unable to care for the children. The church then tries their very best to find a home for the children, though on occasion usual during hard times, they would have to put children into orphanages. 

Seeing how concerned Jean and Mellerel were about Kipp possibly being place in an orphanage, Father Varan asked Sister Ameta (the Leonin apprentice) to send a raven to Mother Abigail in Baolanach, the capital of Myrland, requesting her to search for a family who wishes to adopt a baby boy. 

Father Varan assured that Kipp will most likely be adopted by a family, especially since Myrland isn't experiencing hard times. However, he needed to let you be aware that's a possibility. Father Varan asked how long the group were staying. You all said at least a few days and he said that Mother Abigail will probably get back to him by then. He then told the party that they're free to come by anytime to check on Kipp.
