# Common knowledge of Solteria

Solteria has three continents (two explored and one unexplored) and five major bodies of water. The three continents are the northern continent known as **Nuryu (New-rye-u)**, the southern continent known as **Syrelion (Sy-reel-e-on)**, and the northernmost and unexplored continent known as **Xugrera (Zoo-gree-ra)**. The five major bodies of water are **The Shrouded Deep**, **the Endless Ocean**, **the Winter Shoals**, **the Snow Gale Sea**, and **the Traverse Sea**.

## Continents and Countries

### Xugrera

**Xugrera (Zoo-gree-ra)** is the northernmost and only continent that has yet to be explored. With the almost consistent intense weather of the Snow Gale Sea as well as its seemingly infinite cliffs, no exploration has been able to survey this mysterious continent. 

### Nuryu

**Nuryu (New-rye-u)** is the largest and the northern continent of Solteria. There are a total of eight countries on Nuryu.

#### The Hiano

**The Hiano (High-ann-o)** is the northern most country in the world. Its environment is that of interior Russia (Sub-arctic and arctic climate). Much of the country is covered in ice and snow for most of the year. Its biome is primarily that of grasslands though the further one travels from the Snow Gale Sea, the more taiga forests one will encounter.

Mostly a loose confederation of tribes, the Hianolese are currently suffering from what they call "the Great Famine". Many of their Yakarak herds are suffering from a newly discovered plague dubbed the Yakarak Pox. Additionally, their winter cereals crops are experiencing a blight from cold weather fungi.

#### The Istrarian Dynasty

**The Istrarian (Is-tray-re-an) Dynasty** is the second largest country in the world. Its environment is that of the North American continent and varies significantly due to its landmass. From mountains and deserts to deciduous forests and grasslands, the Istrarian Dynasty is one of only two countries that have all known biomes.   

The Istrarian Dynasty is a totalitarian government ruled by a Lich "Family" known as the Istrari. The current ruler of the Istrarian Dynasty is the Patriarch Troraidos Istrari. The "family" is power hungry and have been using their small elite Lich military known as the Black Crescent, as well as their regular army known as the Gray Suns to try and conquer the world. Fortunately, there are both geographic barriers as well as the Volquiria Kingdom preventing the Dynasty from controlling all of Nuryu. 

#### Kreslavia

**Kreslavia (Cree-slaw-v-a)** is a country located in southeast Nuryu. Despite the fact that Kreslavia is near the equator, the majority of the country has an environment akin to Romania, with hot humid summers and cold snowy winters.

Kreslavia is a monarchy with the current ruler being by an elf known as Count Dimitri von Schildenfeld. He was an only child and currently has no living heir.

#### Myrland

**Myrland (Mire-land)** is a country located in the northwest part of Nuryu. Its environment is akin to Scotland with bogs, mires, and swamps being dotted throughout. Myrland has cool, wet summers and cold, snowy winters.

Myrland is a monarchy currently being ruled by the MacSual. Recently, the human king of Myrland, King Thomas MacSual, lost his battle with Spinebreak Disease thus causing his nine year old half-elf daughter, Ceana MacSual to ascend to the throne.

#### Ocumiel

**Ocumiel (O-sa-um-il)** is a desert country located in the southern part of Nuryu. Its environs is much like Saudi Arabia with much of the land being desert with oasis dotted here and there. 

Ocumiel is a theocracy whose current leader is known as Sualtana Azariah of Fojahl, a genasi. Sualtana Azariah is believed to have been divinely appointed by their god, the Uncreated Creator, through the drawing of lots.

#### Rylia

**Rylia (Rye-lee-a)** is located just south of Myrland. Its environment is similar to that of England with much more forests than Myrland. 

Rylia is a monarchy whose ruler is a human, Queen Gwenhaela Morvan. She had no natural children, but had declared her adopted son, a halfing known as Danret Underwood, as her heir. Rylia has very good relations with Myrland.

#### Volquiria Kingdom

**The Volquiria (Vole-care-re-a) Kingdom** is the largest country in the world. Its environment is similar to North America and varies significantly due to its landmass. From mountains and deserts to deciduous forests and grasslands, the Volquiria Kingdom is the other country that has all known biomes.   

The Volquiria Kingdom is a monarchy that is currently being ruled by Volquiria the Immortal, the masked hero that established the kingdom thousands of years ago. The Volquiria Kingdom and the Istrarian Dynasty has been at war with each other for over 500 years, when the Istrari began to look into achieving Lichdom.

#### Zuzan Empire

**The Zuzan (Zeus-san) Empire** is located off the eastern coast of Nuryu. Its environment is similar to the Amazon rain forest in South America.

The Zuzan Empire is a mysterious country whose rulers and people are unknown. It is the only closed country in the world, with the exception of a small outpost on the country's coast called The Wharf. Here sailors would pick up exports and drop off imports under the watchful eye of an masked individual known solely as the Watchman.  

### Syrelion 

**Syrelion (Sy-reel-e-on)** is the Southern Continent of Solteria. It has five countries. 

#### Aholux

**Aholux (A-who-la)** is the the northern most country on Syrelion. Its enviroment is similar to that of the Amazon rain forest in South America

Aholux has been thrown into anarchy due to a civil war between numerous kindreds with the current "leader" of Aholux being a human name Bane LeCrouix of the Flintlockers Kindred.

#### Kraytion

**Kraytion (Kray-tee-on)** is located in the southern part of Syrelion. Its environment is similar to the interior of Antarctica.

Despite the fact that Kraytion is located in one of the most unforgiving environments in the world, most if not the entire population of Kraytion lives near the center of the country within a large ancient tower known as the Citadel. Kraytion is a monarchy that is currently being run by Lady-in-Waiting Karlynn Palegaze until Queen Nadine Starbrooke becomes of age.

#### Laisora Republic

**The Laisora (La-soar-a) Republic** is the second largest country on Syrelion. Its environment is similar to Peru, with mountains and rain forest in the northern parts of the country and deserts and grasslands in the southern parts of the country.

The Laisora Republic is a republic whose current ruler a half-elf known as Madam President Nakara Yura. Elections are held every six years.

#### Shezian Domain

**The Shezian (Shay-san) Domain** is the largest country on the Syrelion continent. Its environment is much like the central United States with grasslands and some deserts located in the western part of the country and forests located in the eastern part of the country. 

The Shezian Domain is ruled by a council of seven guild heads with the ruling council member currently part of the Steelshade Blacksmith's Guild, dwarf Thorruk Goldmaul. Elections for the head of the council occurs every ten years.

## Oceans and Seas

### The Endless Ocean

**The Endless Ocean** is the largest ocean in Solteria due to the fact that no one has found its end. Many expeditions have gone to explore the Endless Ocean in an attempt to circumnavigate Solteria, but every expedition either disappeared or had to turn back due to the ships running low on supplies.

There is a commonly known Point of No Return among the sailors of Solteria known as **Leviathan's End**. Leviathan's End is a rocky island that appears to be in the shape of a Leviathan. All ships that had sailed passed Leviathan's End have never returned.

### The Shrouded Deep

**The Shrouded Deep** is considered the deepest ocean in the world. On average, the Shrouded Deep goes from sea level to a depth in which a sailor's lead line is unable to measure its deep about one mile off the coasts. Sitting ominously twenty miles off the coasts is a blanket of dense fog, known as the Shroud. The Shroud obscures the rest of the ocean west of that point. All ships that enter the fog either disappears or appears at a point where the ship was nowhere near before (ex: The Endless Ocean) with most of the crew either dead or gone mad.

Due to the Shroud obscuring the Shrouded Deep, the weather on the western coasts of Nuryu and Syrelion is highly unpredictable and, until recently, uninhabited. 

### Snow Gale Sea

The **Snow Gale Sea** is the northern most ocean in the world. The sea is covered in ice most of the year and the weather is highly unpredictable, though not as unpredictable as the weather in the Shrouded Deep.

Despite the unpredictability of the weather, fishing guilds and refugees fleeing from the famine in the Hiano and the Istrarian Dynasty risks sailing these waters.

### Transverse Sea

The **Transverse Sea** is the busiest ocean in the world. Nearly all major shipping lanes go through the Traverse Sea and it is the primary passageway for ships sailing from Nuryu to Syrelion.

### The Winter Shoals

The **Winter Shoals** is the shallowest ocean in the world. With the unpredictability of the weather as well as seemingly random ocean depths, it takes great skill and precising sailing these waters. Those who are not experience in sailing the Winter Shoals tend to run aground.
