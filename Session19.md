# Session 19

## Bob's Blacksmith

After breakfast with Brightpicker, Jean and Mellerel went back to camp to tell their unofficial troupe to go on ahead to the next town, Beitean, and they'll catch up. The troupe said sounds good and they will see you all later. 

While they waited for Mellerel and Jean, Garak and Eeddi began practicing lock-picking. Once Jean and Mellerel got back, the party heads over to Bob's Blacksmith to ask him about the hexagonal metal plate that Garak drew. Bob was of course foraging and still wearing his sensory deprivation helmet. Despite that, Bob was able to completely understand what you were saying due to being able to read lips. 

You guys ask him about it and Bob tells you that this seems to be a base to something much bigger and that it seems to be a device that opens according to the grooves on the edge. The group asks Bob if he have ever had someone order some the parts to make a Mech Chet from him. Bob gave the party the impression that he wasn't sure, but he said that he can recreate the base of this device if the group wants. Jean and Mellerel shut that down quick while Garak and Eeddi were like "YES! DO IT!"

Bob ended up not making a replica of the plate seeing how serious Jean and Mellerel were that no one should recreate even a small part of the device. Bob then said that if you want you can come in and Bob can start looking into past orders. The party took him up on his offer and went inside his house.

Bob's house is as far away from a bachelor pad as possible. In fact, the inside of his house was akin to that of an older retired person. He brought the party into the living room area where an entire wall was a bookshelf and there was a large and beautiful painting of a mountain meadow located near the Heaven's Spires. Bob went to make some tea for the party and the group began to make themselves at home.

While Bob was making tea, Garak and Eeddi browsed the book shelf. Garak read up on fungi to learn more about the fungi that is disrupting the loggers work in a book called Magical Fungi and how to be a Fun Guy. There wasn't any information on those weird mushrooms. Garak decided to look in another book called The Art of Chi Bending and wrote down the spell for Burning hands. Eeddi looked in a very cool spell book called The Definitive Handbook of Counter curses and wrote down the spell for Protection from Good and Evil. 

Both Eeddi and Garak are able to craft a spell scroll for Protection from Good and Evil as well as Burning Hands. Mellerel took in the beautiful painting of the mountain meadow while Jean just relaxed. 

Bob came back from making tea and offered some to the party. Mellerel inquiry about the painting and Bob told her that last summer he closed up shop for a week and went on a backpacking trip to Rosgana Foothills and the smaller peaks of the Heaven's Spires. He painted that on that backpacking trip. 

That party was rather impressed by Bob's talent. After tea, Bob showed the party a room with his past order forms. He showed the drawers that had an the order forms for the past six months and he, Eeddi, and Mellerel began to comb through the past six months of order forms while Garak and Jean decided to go to the Murchadha Lumber and Furniture store to speak to Orilee about Baron's criminal involvement. 

## The Murchadha Lumber and Furniture store

Garak and Jean arrived at the Murchadha Lumber and Furniture store to find that there was a huge line to get into the store. The majority of the patrons were carnies from Bellindana's Big Top. Many of the actual performers were very rude though those who were support workers were merely normal patrons. 

To squeeze inside, Jean put on a small street magic show and successful managed to get the audience into the show. Garak managed to squeeze through the door and into the furniture store. Garak ran into carnies who were showing off their stick juggling skills. The halfling store worker Jilril tried hard to get them to stop because of the fact that it was already crowded in here and she didn't want anything to get broken. The carnies told her not to worry because they're professionals and aren't going to break anything. 

Garak continued to squeeze his way to the front where Orilee was manning the front desk. Instead of Baron being there to help with loading, there was a random Goliath. Garak asked Orilee if he could talk to her privately for a few minutes. Orilee told him that she really can't right now, but that she can meet you at the Nightclaw Inn after she closes. 

Garak then said in thieves cant that he'll be quick and asked what exactly Baron was dealing in and if any of it was weapons. Orilee responded in fluent thieves cant that he only deals in drugs, alcohol, and contraband items like candy, playing cards, etc. Garak then said that he'll be happy to meet her at the Nightclaw Inn this evening. Orilee said thanks and Garak left. 

Once Garak was outside, he began to investigate the building of the Murchadha Lumber and Furniture store. There was a small marking of a black sun rising. Right under the symbol was the phrase "The sun rises at midnight". Garak didn't recognize the gang who's mark it was. So he met back up with Jean who just finished his mini street magic show. The two then headed back to Bob's to see how Eeddi, Mellerel, and Bob was doing. 

## Bob's order forms

After a couple of hours searching through past invoices, you found that the only orders for hexagonal plates were from Oratig, the owner and operator of the Omnipharmacon Apothecary. Bob and Eeddi were quick to point out that they're a good family and would never be involved with dangerous pranks.

Jean said that maybe true, but someone could have broke in and stole something. Bob and the party agreed on that theory. Since it was nearing lunch time, the group decided to head back to Brightpicker's Repair Shop and see if they can eavesdrop on the conversation between Brightpicker and the Metal Ones.

## The Plan

Go to Brightpicker's Repair Shop to see if they can eavesdrop on the conversation and sound of the energy source of the Mech Chet. Afterwards, go to the Omnipharmacon and question Oratig about his hexagonal metal plates. Then, either try to talk to Baron and/or meet up with Orilee and talk to her about her brother.
