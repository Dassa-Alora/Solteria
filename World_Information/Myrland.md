# Myrland

Myrland is a small country located in the northwest region of Nuryu. It is bordered by the Shrouded Deep to the west, the Snow Gale Sea to the north, the Istrarian Dynasty to the east, and Rylia to the south.

## Notable Geographic Locations

### The Heaven's Spires

Acting as a geographical buffer between Myrland and the Istrarian Dynasty is a mountain range known as the Heaven's Spires. Despite the fact that the mountain range itself isn't too long, the Heaven's Spires is the tallest mountain range in all of Solteria. The Heaven's Spires follow the entire border of Myrland and all but a small part of the Rylia's southeastern border.

The Heaven's Spires are pretty desolate and have a harsh climate, thus there are not many inhabitants in the area. There are a few Goliath and Dragonborn clans that wander the lower altitudes of the Heaven's Spires. But asides from them, the Heaven's Spires is very bleak and barren place  

### The Rosgana Foothills

The Rosgana Foothill is an area where the elevation quickly climbs towards the Heaven's Spires. The terrain is fairly rugged with some forested areas dotted throughout the Rosgana Foothills. Some lumber camps have been established on the Foothills, but due to the extremely winter weather and rocky terrain, it is not financially feasible to exploit the few forests that dotted the landscape. 

Despite the weather and harsh terrain, the Rosgana Foothills have numerous tribes and clans that have successfully make a life for themselves herding Giant Snow Capybaras and Yakarak through the area and selling their furs and meat to numerous outposts and towns along the boundary of the Rosgana Foothills and the Gogashire Woods. 

### The Gogashire Woods

The Gogashire Woods is a coniferous forest located at the base of the Rosgana Foothills. It is the only forest within Myrland that is considered profitable. Historical records indicate that Myrland used to be a heavily forested country. However, due to the lumber being in constant high demand and extremely profitable, Myrland has experienced massive deforestation over the past few hundred years. 

The Gogashire Woods are home to numerous towns and villages where people live all year round, including the town of Elagdias. During the winter, the nomads from the Rosgana Foothills and the Heaven's Spire make camp at the edge of the Gogashire Woods. This has caused much strife for the nomads and the people of the towns and villages within the Gogashire Woods. Both the nomads and the townsfolk rely on the resources that are within the forest, such as animals for food and clothing, lumber for firewood, and other necessities needed to survive the cold winters. Because of this strife, it had led to a cold resource war between the nomads and the townsfolk of the Gogashire Woods.

### The Grindago Mire

The Grindago Mire is a large swamp the acts as a geographical border for the countries of Myrland and Rylia. The swamp is located along the southern border of Myrland and the northern border of Rylia. There are currently two well established "roads" that lead through the Grindago Mire, however the more eastern route is typically closed during the winter due to the treacherous terrain and harsh weather. 

## Notable Water Features

### The Mhoire River

The Mhoire River is the largest river in Myrland. The headwaters of the Mhoire River are located in the Heaven's Spires and empties into the Shrouded Deep. There are numerous farms, towns, and cities along the riverbanks. Most of the residents who live on the banks of the Mhoire River rely on it for drinking water and irrigation.

The Mhoire River is a huge destination for fishermen, whether they fish for leisure or for provision. The Advance Angler's Affiliate (AAA) has purchased numerous plots of land along the Mhoire River as well as many other rivers within Myrland using questionable business practices.

### The Asgaidn River 

The Asgaidn River is a large river whose headwaters are located in the Heaven's Spires and flows into the Mhoire River. As with all rivers located in Myrland, there are numerous farms, towns, and cities that are built on the banks of the Asgaidn River. 

The lumber town known as Elagdias is located along the banks of the Asgaidn River. As with nearly all major rivers in Myrland, the AAA has purchased numerous plots of land along the Asgaidn riverbanks. 

### The Salmon River

The Salmon River is a large man-made river that was created by the Advance Angler's Affiliate, also known as the AAA. The company utilized their engineers to create numerous dams up in the Heaven's Spires as the artificial headwaters of the Salmon River. The Salmon River, as well as all land within five miles of the river, is owned by the AAA. 

The AAA is currently looking to create a tributary of the Salmon River that would eventually connect to the Asgaidn and the Eorrian River. However, the AAA has been having difficulty obtaining land rights in the area.

### Lake Baolanach

Lake Baolanach is the largest and deepest lake in all of Myrland. No lead line has successfully measured the depth of Lake Baolanach. The capital city of Myrland, Baolanach, is located on the banks of Lake Baolanach and the Baolanach River. The area around the Baolanach River and Lake Baolanach is the most populated area of Myrland.

### Lake Eorrian

Lake Eorrian is a large lake located in the northern part of Myrland. Much of the land on the western banks of Lake Eorrian have been bought by the AAA while the land on the eastern banks are own by the Consulate of Eorrian, an elf woman name Vasati Reyhana, in an attempt to push the AAA out of the region. 

## Notable Cities

The current ruler of Myrland, Queen Ceana MacSual, lives in the castle known as Enbarr's Stronghold. 

### Cormaig, home to Myrland Arcane Institute

Cormaig is a small town located in south central Myrland. It is located along the banks of the Mhoire River and is home to to only college in Myrland, the Myrland Arcane Institute. Cormaig's main source of income comes from the Myrland Arcane Institute.

Unfortunately, the AAA have managed to steal talent away from the university by promising magic users and academics free training and money to work for them. This has led to Cormaig becoming bankrupt and forcing numerous cuts in positions and salaries at the Myrland Arcane Institute as well as selling a large portion of land around Cormaig to the AAA to pay the bills.   

### Haddock Cross, Cod Row, Salmon Outpost (Advance Angler's Affiliate Towns)

Haddock Cross, Cod Row, and Salmon Outpost are all fishing towns that have been bought and now own by the Advance Angler's Affiliate, the largest fishing guild in the world. Prior to the creation gripple, the coasts of Myrland were sparsely populated and only saw visitors, mainly fishermen, during the summer months when the weather was most stable. 

Since the creation of gripple, the AAA has bought the few summer fishermen camps on the coasts and created gripple warehouse slums on the coasts for their workers and their families to live in. Haddock Cross and Cod Row's main industry is fishing. Salmon Outpost does have a small fishing population, but Salmon Outpost's main function is to process Istrarian and Hianolese refugees into the AAA.
