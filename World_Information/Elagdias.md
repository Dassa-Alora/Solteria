The Gogashire Woods is a coniferous forest that reaches from Elagdias into the Rosgana Foothills and up to the treeline fo the Heaven's Spires. Elagdias and the areas west of the town typically have longer winters than the rest of Myrland due to its elevation and its proximity to the Heaven's Spires.

The main gods that the people of Elagdias follow are Grelasis, the goddess of wild nature, Rogbium, the god of the forest, and Zeanke, goddess of the hunt. Despite the fact that many residents of Elagdias worship all three deities, their primary deity is Rogbium the god of the forest. Rogbium have a temple dedicated to him in Elagdias.
