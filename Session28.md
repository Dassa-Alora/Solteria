# Session 28

The Silent Man strikes Xi-Tao in the head with his cane to stop Xi-Tao from running off with Jean. During that time, Garak, Eeddi, and Mellerel continued to distract the Istrarian Dynasty soldiers from where Jean was trying to get Meng and Xi-Tao out. 

Around this time, Gage and Brent run out of the burning tent. Brent took in the scene and ordered Gage to get the Mech Chet and stick with the plan. Gage managed to grab the Mech Chet and escape the recon camp so he can stick to the plan.


Brent then runs to the smaller tent yelling for all his soldiers to burn it all. Brent dismantled the small tent and began to guide his soldiers to the transportation portal to escape. Mellerel continued to use her spooky spooks to attack the camp while Eeddi had her back. 

The Silent Man tried to drag Xi-Tao out of Jean's grip, but Jean managed to be able to drag Xi-Tao out of the Silent Man's grip with Garak helping him out. The Silent Man then told Jean telepathically that "You may have protected the boy now. But soon he will be in the hands of the Istrarian Dynasty."

After that, the Silent Man went back to the transportation portal and jumped in and disappeared. Brent managed to get all his men who were still alive out as well as one of the 3 horses before the mushroom began to grow exponentially due to the magical fire.

The party managed to escape with Meng and Xi-Tao before the mushroom ate everyone. Once they got cleared of the mushroom's devouring range, Jean cast Dancing Lights to wake Mellerel up from her spooky spooks. 

After that, the party looked up to see a gigantic mushroom towering over the Gogashire Woods.
