# Session 24

## Meeting back up 

After Mellerel and Garak finished going through the Tinker's Contest, the two met back up with Jean who was starting to pack up his magic show. Garak mentioned that he met Xi-Tao who was a contestant in the children's age group of the Tinker's Contest. Mellerel also mentioned that she met Brightpicker, who appeared to be fully recovered and rested from his seemingly sleep deprivation. 

## Cake Decorating Contest

Jean pointed out that Gage is participating in the cake decorating contest. The party walked over to the Elagdias Town Fair Cake Decorating Contest and began to ask questions about the contest. 

Eventually, the party decided to enter the cake decorating contest. By paying three gold and entering the contest, Jean, Mellerel, and Garak each got to borrow a small kitchenette complete with cake baking ingredients and accessories. The party each got a contest watcher to make sure you weren't using magic for the cake decorating contest. 

Mellerel was matched up with a carnival worker name Kari who was not really hating her job, but not really liking it either. Garak had one of the MCs of the carnival named Philip who absolutely loves his job. Jean got a high school age kid named Ryu who regretted running away with the circus. 

## Mellerel

Mellerel managed to an okay job mixing the ingredients up. But she had a rough time baking the cake as she was worried that the cake was afraid of the dark and kept opening the oven to make sure the cake wasn't scared. As a result, her cake was baked to the consistency of jello. Despite this, Mellerel was able to craft a beautiful flower garden on the jiggly cake. 

## Garak

Garak started to mix the ingredients together and suddenly got really into the contest and was hyper-focused with winning the cake decorating contest. He did a good job mixing the ingredients and baking the cake. Garak was even doing a great job with the cake decorating until he decided to use the dream spawn bone as the pupil for his Eye of Saruon cake. 

## Jean 

Jean managed to use magic to create an exact replica of Bellindana's Big Top without getting caught by Ryu. Mainly, thanks to the fact that Ryu hates his job and kind of zones out most of the time. Ryu did show Jean some of his magic tricks that he was hoping would get him a spot as a magician, but Ryu told Jean that they had seen that same trick a hundred times from a hundred different people. So they assigned Ryu as a laborer since his tricks were not impressive and he's been miserable ever since. 

## Cake Decorating Contest Winners

Once 9 came around Philip walked to the center of the amphitheater and announce the winners of the contest. The judges were a few townsfolk and to Philip's dismay elected Jean as the 3rd place winner. 

Jean thoroughly enjoyed rubbing his third place win in the face of Philip who couldn't really do anything except accept it and hand Jean a gift card to Buy the Way general store. 

In second place, Druug the Lord Mayor's chef, won by creating a creature from Gith folklore, Osimacheta. Osimacheta are basically Deep Ones, but instead of fins they have flappers like penguins. 

In first place, the Owlin known as Gage won. He created a landscape that is located in the Shezian Domain, on the southern continent of Syrelion. Gage thoroughly enjoyed explaining that he crafted a landscape scene of the Gates of Winter mountain range and took some creative liberties by including owls flying over the mountain range instead of native birds. 

## Cake tasting

After the award ceremony, the people of Elagdias and the contestants began to eat the cake decorating contest. Queen Ceanna and Lord Protector Drift walked up to Mellerel. Queen Ceanna commented on how beautiful Mellerel's cake and asked if she can try the cake. 

Mellerel said sure and cut the Queen a slice of cake. The second Mellerel cut into the cake, the cake sort of "melted" due to the fact that the cake was way underdone. Queen Ceanna tried the cake and did her best to give Mellerel the impression that the cake tasted good. Queen Ceanna and Drift then walked over to the next cake decorating contestant's table. Ceanna looked sadly down at Mellerel's uncooked cake and quickly scraped her cake off her plate and into the trashcan. 

Gage then approached Garak and told Garak that he admired his artistic skills in the cake decorating contest. He mentioned that he doesn't do much horror genre when it comes to his baking, but he enjoys seeing what creative ideas that the artists comes up with. Gage then suggested that next time Garak decorate a cake that he should use something edible for the pupil or at least something that is not dead. Gage then asked to try his cake and Garak gave him a slice. Gage tasted it and nodded his approval. He then told Garak good job and then went on his way.

After a bit, Jean walked up to Druug and Gage who were talking to each other and congratulating one another. Jean then suggested that they should go out for drinks to which Gage and Druug accepted the offer enthusiastically.

## The Plan

Jean is hoping to keep Gage engaged with drinking, while Garak and Mellerel keep a close eye on Xi-Tao at the Tinker's Contest.
