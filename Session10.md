# Session 10

## The Murchadha Lumber Mill

Elraina and Baron started to argue about him including Danny into a contraband smuggling ring. After a few minutes, a green woman wearing Ranger garb walked through the gates of Elagdias.  As she was walking past Elraina and Baron, Baron got the woman's (Rowena) attention and said "Hey lady. You think loggers have the right to play cards?"

Rowena was all like I really don't care. Baron then asked Rowena if she wanted to deliver chocolate to someone. She said that she had better things to do. Just then Elise walked in on the conversation and it was SUPER obvious to everyone that she and Baron had a thing going on. Baron then asked her if she wanted to deliver chocolate to their supplier. She appeared worried about the question, but after a few seconds she asked "how much they paying?" 

Baron then took Elsie out of earshot of Elraina and Rowena. Despite that, The 2 were able to catch snippets of conversation between the two. You two managed to catch Elise saying "they're creepy" at one point and you managed to catch Baron saying "but art school". 

After a few minutes, Baron and Elise did the "aww so in love" giggles. Baron then left and Elise informed Elraina that she had come to bring Danny and her back to Lord Mayor's Katrin's mansion for lunch and said that "Gruug has made some of his home culture food". Elise then asked Rowena if she wishes to join us for lunch and Rowena was all like "Free food, heck yeah!" 

Elise, Danny, Elraina, and Rowena began to head towards the mansion. As they were walking, Elraina stopped as she saw Garak, Jean, Eeddi, and Mellerel walking down the street. Elraina, Garak, Jean, Eeddi, and Mellerel were all like "hey I know you!" 

Elise then spotted Mellerel and ran up to her. She asked if dropping the baby off with Father Varan worked out and she was like "uh yeah they said that they'll find Kipp a home." Elise then asked slightly uncomfortable if they wanted to have lunch with Lord Mayor Katrin. They took her up on the offer. 

The group then continued on towards the mansion. A few seconds later, the group hears someone running up to them. They turned around to see a collage aged elf woman. Elise greeted her saying "Hi Orilee." 

Orilee greeted the group and walked up to Eeddi. She told Eeddi how she heard that her father stiffed Eeddi out of the bill for the lumber mill repairs. So she took the money out of the cash register so that she could pay Eeddi and Eeddi wouldn't have to worry too much about interacting with her father. 

Eeddi was worried about Orilee getting in trouble for stealing from the furniture store cash register, but Orilee assured her that Baron said that he has it covered. Orilee then waved good bye and headed back to the lumber mill. The party then continued to the Lord Mayor's Katrin's mansion for lunch.

## Walter

Elise leads the group to through the Lord Mayor's courtyard and towards the mansion. Right before she led them into the mansion, she told the group not to freak out because the Lord Mayor has an unusual pet that is off-putting for many who meet Walter. 

The group said no problem and Elise led them into the mansion. Upon immediately entering the mansion, the group was shocked that the Lord Mayor had a gigantic undead octopus as a pet. Upon seeing the octopus, everyone in the group were in awe, curious, and/or slightly fearful at Walter. 

Eeddi was super excited for meeting Walter and immediately began to ask questions about where did Walter come from and why does the Lord Mayor have a undead octopus. Mellerel was worried about Walter and was trying to inquire whether Walter was a creature of light or a creature of dark. Jean and Garak were all like what does it eat. 

Eeddi then cast detect magic to see if Walter was magical. Walter was indeed glowing green. Eeddi's eyes were also drawn to a pink glowing piece of coral. Elraina then cast Speak with Animals and began to talk to Walter about what happened to him and where he came from. 

Walter explained how when Lord Mayor Katrin was a child, her parents took her to the coast of the Shrouded Deep. It was summer time so it was safe to visit the coasts of Myrland. While Katrin was hunting for seashells along the beach, she found Walter who seemed to be a dying young octopus. She took Walter back to the campsite and convinced her parents to try to nurse him back to help. 

Walter took a liking to Katrin and she managed to convince her parents to keep him. Because the octopus appearance was still rotting and seemed like he was dying, her parents took Walter to numerous vets to see if they can help Walter get better. Unfortunately, no vets were able to heal Walter of whatever affliction he had. 

After that, every summer Katrin would take Walter back to the Shrouded Deep so that Walter can enjoy the ocean. Walter told Elraina that he did enjoy swimming in the ocean, but after a few hours he begins to feel uncomfortable and frightened by the Shrouded Deep. So he would come back to Katrin and he would go back into his aquarium. 

When pressed to see what happened to Walter, Walter said that he didn't remember but whatever happened he has no desire to return to a life in the Shrouded Deep. 

Once the group was satisfied with the fact that Walter enjoyed living with the Lord Mayor and was being treated well, Elise began to lead the group towards the dining room. As they started to walk towards the dining room, Eeddi walked up to the magical pink glowing piece of coral. She was about to touch the coral when Walter began to bang furiously on the glass of his aquarium. 

Elise then told Eeddi that she won't touch that if she was her unless she wants to be confused about where she was or who she is for the next few days to weeks. Eeddi then refrained herself from touching the coral and followed the rest of the group into the dining room of the Lord Mayor's mansion.

Eeddi then refrained herself from touching the coral and followed the rest of the group into the dining room of the Lord Mayor's mansion. 

Lunch with the Lord Mayor

The group then entered the dining room to see that the Lord Mayor was already at the table. She greeted the party and invited them to sit down. She then asked Danny how rock hunting went and he said that it was good. Then the Lord Mayor's cook, Ruug came out of the kitchen to serve lunch. 

Ruug announced that he proudly made a dish from his home culture called Varlog. The dish looked like it was a mixed millipede and eel that had been cooked. When Danny saw the lunch, he quickly said that he's going to have lunch with Baron and ran off. Gruug then served everyone some Varlog. 

Garak was super stoked for Varlog. He started to dig in and realized that it was decent. Too fishy for his taste, but still enjoyed the Varlog. Elise tried a bite and was super surprised that it actually tasted pretty good. Elraina politely try some but stop shortly after a few bites. Eeddi kind of moved the Varlog around making it looked like she was eating it. Jean used his illusionary skills to make it look like he was eating and enjoying the Varlog. Mellerel was super excited to try the Varlog. She bite into it and barely made the percentile save for needing to vomit. Rowena was all like "what is this, this is disgusting, give me some rabbit!" 

Gruug was a bit disappointed that not many of the lunch attendees enjoyed his home culture dish of Varlog. But he said that he would of course make a rabbit dish for Rowena. Gruug then asked if anyone wanted anything else and Eeddi asked for bacon. Gruug was all like "bacon, yeah, Danny said that bacon is good for all" Gruug then went back into the kitchen to cook a dish of rabbit and bacon. 

While Gruug was in the kitchen, Jean dismissed himself to go to the restroom. He walked out of the dining room and headed to Walter's aquarium. As Jean approached Walter carrying a large napkin of Varlog that he had been making disappear, Walter began to get super excited. Jean attempted to throw the napkin full of Varlog into Walter's aquarium, but it all just ended up spilling out from the napkin and covering Jean in Varlog and Varlog eggs. Walter was super disappointed that Jean was so bad at throwing. So Walter took his tentacles and began to try and scrape the Varlog off of Jean and eat it. Walter eyes then got super big due to a brilliant idea. Before Jean knew what happened, Walter quickly wrapped his tentacles around Jean, pulled Jean into the aquarium, sloshed Jean around very fast for a few seconds, then sat Jean down outside the aquarium giving the Harengon a very surprised laundry day. 

Jean was in shock at what happened and cast Silent Image to give the impression that Jean was clean and dry despite the fact that he was soaked and grimy. He then walked back into the dining room. As he walked back in, Gruug came out of the kitchen and served Rowena some cooked rabbit, steam vegetables, and bread. He then put a gigantic plate of bacon in the middle of the table. 

Lord Mayor Katrin then asked more about the party stating that she already knows Elraina and somewhat Eeddi (she's on her invite to dinner list) but she isn't familiar with Rowena, Garak, Jean, and Mellerel. Lord Mayor Katrin then asked who they are.
