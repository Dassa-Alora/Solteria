# Session 1 (Short Arc) #

You all discovered that you are standing in the courtyard of the All Faiths Church located in Woodsford, Rylia. The church and its grounds are run down and have not been maintain. You find this odd especially since the All Faiths Church in Woodsford is currently open and one of the more popular pilgrimage sites for those who follow the Solteria Pantheon. You begin to explore the church grounds for clues of who may have brought you here and any clues as what has happened to make a once extremely popular religious destination to fall into a state of decay. As Elraina began to take in her surroundings, she noticed an unusual symbol that appeared to be glowing and seemed to have been carved into the church's doors.

## Two Stand Alone Graves ##

The two stand alone graves are between two leafless aspen trees.

Grave 1: Clodia Windgaze / 17 / A beautiful life that came to an end due to the darkness that was within

Grave 2: Roddie Freeglide / 17 / See! This is what happens when your idiot brother and his lady joins a cult!

Eeddi cast Detected Magic and saw that the two G's (Windgaze and Freeglide) were illusioned to appear as a G in Undercommon and a G in Giant. When Eeddi and Garak pressed the unusual Gs the symbol on the door glowed brighter. When the two pressed the unusual Gs again the symbol glowed dimmer. After a bit, you all went back to the church's doors and saw that above the symbol there was

~ ~ G ~ G

Eeddi recalled that about 3 years ago Woodsford was struggling with putting down a minor cult. She recalled that two teenagers who were associated with found and they had died under mysterious circumstances.  

## Storage Shed Area ##

After Garak got bored button pressing, he went to investigated what appeared to be a Storage Shed. As he approached the storage shed, the chain and padlock as well as the door shuddered violently. Garak decided that it was best not to open the shed by himself and head back to the party who had now relocated at the church.

## Church ##

Mellerel decided that she had enough of this dark and moonless winter night and attempted to open the church's doors. As her hand attempted to grab the doorknob, her hand was harmlessly reflected off the doorknob. Jean suggested that the party should find the other three letters. The party then heads away from the church to examine the church's gate. Above the church's gate, there are words written in Celestial upon the gate's arch. Since none of the party were able to read Celestial, Jean attempted to jump and touch as many of the letters as possible on the gate's arch. Unfortunately, none of the letters lit up and appeared on the church's symbol. The party then decided to check out the church's memorial garden.

## Memorial Garden ## 

The party arrives at the Memorial Garden that was located on the east side of the church. It was clear that the garden had not been maintain. The fountain in the center of the memorial garden had what looked like red-green algae coated on the stone where water once was. The memorial wall itself was covered with dead vines and plants that had encroached upon the memorial. You all walked up to the memorial wall to see hundreds upon hundreds of names etched onto the wall. This was a memorial for some sort of catastrophe. After some checks, Eeddi remembers that this memorial was dedicated to those who fought and died in the Undying War.

The Undying War was a six-month war fought between Rylia and the Istrarian Dynasty approximately 300 years ago. You all know that the Istrarian Dynasty attempted to conquer Rylia. After numerous failed attempts to conquer Rylia due to its geographic barriers, the Istrarian Dynasty decided that this so called Undying War was pointless and the country was not worth the large amount of resources that would be needed to conquer it. 

While the party looks through the hundreds of names upon the memorial, you find the third level of the five letter word located on a name that had been scratched out. The letter was K and it was written Abyssal. After the party turned the letter K on, they went back to the church to see the following

K ~ G ~ G

The party then decided to search the back of the church. As they walked behind the church, the party sees a wooden backdoor. Mellerel desperately wanting to get out of the dark attempted to grabbed the door knob again, but her hand merely reflected back as the symbol that was on the front doors of the church suddenly appears on this door.
