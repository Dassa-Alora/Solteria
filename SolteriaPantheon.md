## The Order of the Uncreated Creator

The Order of the Uncreated Creator is a religion that is mainly found in the country of Ocumiel though followers of the Uncreated Creator are scattered throughout Solteria. The holy book of the Order of the Uncreated Creator is known as the Codex of the One. Though the majority of Solterians look down upon those who are in the Order of the Uncreated Creator, their animosity towards the Order is nothing compared to their animosity towards Animism.

## Animism 

There are numerous people groups, primarily those who are members of a tribe or are nomads, follow the religion known as Animism. Animism is the belief that objects, places, and creatures all possess a particular spiritual essence. Overall, the majority of the Solteria population looks down upon those individuals who follow Animism due to the belief that they have no loyalty to any deity. Animism is mainly found in the Hiano and Aholux. Those who are followers of Animism have no holy book and instead prefers to rely on oral traditions.
