# Session 4 (Short Arc) #

Elraina, Jean, and Garak found themselves confronting what was essentially the Pale Man from Pan's Labyrinth. Meanwhile, Eeddi and Mellerel's minds were full of unusual visions and terrifying aberrations. 

## Balcony ##

Elraina, Jean, and Garak began to fight the Pale Man who had now unleashed black tentacles from its mouth. During the fight, Eeddi suddenly appeared holding a one inch by one inch smooth teal metallic massless cube in her hand. Eeddi suddenly saw the horrific Pale Man in front of her, yelled "what the f--- we're in a church" and attempted to shoot the Pale Man with Fire Bolt. Unfortunately, it missed. After all, I'd probably miss my range attack too if I suddenly found myself confronted by a tentacle vomiting humanoid. Fortunately, Mellerel then appeared next to Eeddi. Mellerel suddenly realized that she was essentially holding a caltrop made of resin spider legs. Mellerel dropped the disturbing trinket, saw the Pale Man, and proceeded to cast witch bolt at the Pale Man. After some more fighting, Eeddi managed to cast catapult using her newly acquired massless cube, shoot it through the chest of the Pale Man, and having it slam harmlessly into the statue of Shaxthos (shaq-those), the God of Writing.

## Short Rest ##

After the battle, the group decided to take a short rest. During that time, Garak began to dissect the body of the Pale Man for construction materials. While he was operating, he found that the Pale Man was wearing a weird medallion. After some discussion with Jean, it was determine that the symbol was of the Gith, but asides from that nothing else was known about it.

Mellerel began to investigate her resin spider legs caltrop. She felt a sort of familiar connection to it, but didn't like this familiarity. So she put it in her pocket. Eeddi ritual cast detect magic on her massless teal metal cube and was able to see the a rainbow like aura around the cube, showing this cube is emitting off all eight types of magic. Though how to unlock and use the magically massless cube was just anyone's guess.

Elraina meanwhile also tried to figure out what her pentagram dragon necklace was, but aside from feeling a sense of familiarity, nothing has come of it yet.

Also during the short rest, Eeddi began to lecture all the party members on the depictions of the numerous stain glass panes within the All Faiths Church in Woodsford, Rylia.

After the short rest, the party decided to head downstairs. Garak easily managed to unlock the other door on the left side of the alter behind the choir benches. The party then began to descend the stairs. As the party headed down into the basement, you all began to hear the sound of a crying infant.
