# Session 34

## Bob and Danny

After talking to the loggers about the rod and looking through the scientist's purse, you all head to Bob's Blacksmith, where a small group was gathering. When you got there, you heard two people arguing. Danny was arguing with Bob claiming that Bob was undead. Bob stated that was ridiculous especially coming from someone who just saved their life from drowning. You guys asked them what happened and Danny began to give you his version of the story.

Danny told you that Baron let him into the mill earlier so he can go rock hunting. Right before the explosion of the mill, he saw Bob reading by the river side. A second later, the mill exploded and Danny was blown into the river. Danny claimed that Bob was practically at ground zero of the explosion and should have been killed. Danny then began to exclaimed that no one could have survived that and why was his house the only one standing anyway.

At that, people began to mutter why was Bob's house the only one standing. Bob then told the crowd that he knows better not to build a wooden house in a town full of wooden structures in the middle of a forest. Bob then walked over to his house, took out a knife that had a blue tinted blade, and scrapped off paint to show that his house was made out of metal. When confronted that the townspeople saw him carrying wood from the forest, Bob said that he had to paint the metal in the forest because of the large amount of fumes this type of paint caused.

After the crowd mutters ceased, Bob then told you his side of the story. With everyone staying in place, he decided to take advantage of the quietness of the mill and read The Adventures of Palug the Goblin down by the river. Baron had also let him in earlier and Bob began to read the book that Eeddi had lend him. After a while, Bob heard someone walking and spotted Danny walking towards the river. A few seconds later, the mill exploded and Bob was thrown back. After getting his bearings, Bob saw through the cloud of dust and piles of rubble, dead loggers standing up and began to zombie their way towards the town. Through all that, Bob saw Danny walking causally past the zombies into the river. Danny wasn't coming up, so Bob jumped into the river and rescued Danny. At about that time, the zombies began to attack and Danny ran while Bob fought them off. 

During the argument, Lord Mayor Katrin walked in and asked what was going on. She then saw Danny and ran to him asking him where he had been. Danny told him what he told you guys and Katrin believed him because she had no reason not to. 

## Bob 

After the crowd dispersed, the party asked Bob about the Mech Chet diagram that you found in the scientist's purse. Bob told the group he'd look at it if only the party comes with him into the forest to get a break from everything going on. The party agreed and you all went on a 30 minute walk through the Gogashire Woods. 

Once Bob got into his quiet place, he took a look at the Mech Chet diagram. Bob explained how elegantly the machines design was and how mechanically it looks like it could potentially manipulate matter. He pointed out that the energy source in the middle is built in such a way to contain a large amount of energy in a small space. Though he doesn't know anything about the what the energy source itself was as it seems to be alchemical and he has very little knowledge in that realm. 

Bob stated that he wants to make one and Garak and Eeddi enthusiastically agreed and asked if they could help. Before Bob could answer, Jean and Mellerel told them no you don't want to build it and asked for the diagram back. Bob gave it back to the party and told him that he's going to hangout here and relax for a bit. 

## Coral

After talking to Bob, the party headed back to Elagdias. Eeddi then begin to search through the rubble for the pink coral that had caused madness in Danny when he was young. The group began to help Eeddi's search, but you were having trouble finding it. 

## Mission Briefing

The next morning while putting rubble into organized piles, the group heard a couple of loggers discussing about a rumor that Xi-Tao was the one that set off the device. After some discussion, the loggers decided to confront Xi-Tao and his family. The party followed the loggers and ended up in front of the heavily damage Meat Me at Saint Louis's. 

They shouted out for the Stagmans to come out, but no one was there. One of the loggers said that they saw them earlier in the day. The party managed to talk them into leaving, and a few minutes later, Elise came by telling the party that Lord Mayor Katrin wanted to see them. 

The party met up with her and she offered the party three missions. The first mission was going after the Stagmans and making sure they get to the ship at Cod Row safely. The second mission is to escort Elise and Baron down to Cormaig and make sure there's no funny business going on with the Crows of the Midnight Suns. The third mission is to go find a wizard named Fritz and ask him to help get rid of the carnivorous mushrooms that have slowly encroach towards Elagdias. 

After some discussion, the party decided to go after the Stagmans. Lord Mayor Katrin gave the party Black Cards to Elagdias's general store, Buy the Way. She also offered the party 5 of the Murchadha Lumber Guards to go with them. The party denied the offer of guards and began to prepare for their mission.
