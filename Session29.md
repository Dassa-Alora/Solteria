# Session 29

## Heading back to Elagdias

Once the party was out of carnivorous mushroom's way, they decided to head back to Elagdias and tell Xi-Tao's parents all about it. Xi-Tao rejected the telling his parents idea, but told them that he wanted to head home and go to sleep.

Once the party arrives at Meat Me in Saint Louie's, Xi-Tao tried to lock the party out, but Jean broke the doggy door's glass barrier which caused Xi-Tao's brother, Wan-Tao, and his father up. 

His father was super groggy as the party told him and Wan-Tao a brief summary of what Xi-Tao has been up to, but Wan-Tao was pretty alert and wanted more information. The party told Wan-Tao that they really needed to go talk to the mayor about this, but that Xi-Tao should tell Wan-Tao everything.

The party then left the barbaque place with Wan-Tao closing and locking the door behind them. The party then saw Wan-Tao kneel down to talk to Xi-Tao who was hiding under a small table.

## Mayor's house

When the party arrived at Lord Mayor Katrin's manor, they found a lot of activity going on. There were many more guards there and Katrin, Bellindana, and Druug were looking up at the gigantic mushroom that was looming over the Gogashire Woods.

The party got Katrin's attention and asked if they can speak to her somewhere that's not as busy and in front of a certain egotistical individual. Katrin said of course and dismissed Bellindana, who was very annoyed that Baron had not been found.

The party went upstairs and began to tell Katrin all about what had happened. She told the party that if it wasn't for the gigantic mushroom towering over the woods and that Gage's mother had reported him missing, their story would be really hard to believe. 

With the party's advice, she agreed to send out guards to guard Meat Me in Saint Louie's. She also requested the presence of Xi-Tao, Brightpicker, and Queen Ceana. Garak and Jean volunteered to pick up Xi-Tao, while Eeddi went to get Brightpicker and Mellerel went upstairs to get Queen Ceana.

## Bureaucrats Assemble

Jean and Garak followed the Murchadha Lumber Guards to Meat Me in Saint Louie's. When they arrived, Wan-Tao was at the counter keeping an eye out while Xi-Tao and Meng were still hiding under the table. When Wan-Tao saw Jean and Garak, he opened the door and asked them what did they want. Jean and Garak explained that the Mayor wanted to talk to Xi-Tao and Wan-Tao can come with them if he wanted. Wan-Tao agreed but emphasized that having guards escort Xi-Tao to the Mayor's Manor was completely unnecessary. Jean and Garak told Wan-Tao that the guards were going to stay here and protect the store and the family in case the Istrarian soldiers decided to come back. Wan-Tao then talked his little brother into going to the mayor. Jean, Garak, Wan-Tao, Xi-Tao, and Meng then headed to the mayor's manor.

Eeddi went to wake Brightpicker up from bed. He was super groggy and took his time getting dressed and making coffee. Once he was downstairs, Eeddi began to explained what happened. As she told Brightpicker the story, his eyes got wider and wider. After a minute, Brightpicker chugged all of his hot coffee down his throat and followed Eeddi to the mayor's manor.

Mellerel had gone upstairs and knocked on Queen Ceana's door. The Queen's Lord Protector, Drift answered and asked Mellerel what she needed. Mellerel told Drift that the Mayor wanted the queen to come to a meeting. Drift nodded and then woke Queen Ceana up. It was very clear that Ceana was not a morning person as she dragged herself out of bed and got dressed sluggishly. Once she finished getting ready, she followed Drift and Mellerel to the mayor's office sluggishly still carrying her adorable Panda stuffy.

In between of when the party got the people that the Mayor had requested and arriving at the Mayor's office, Oratig had arrived. Once everyone arrived, Xi-Tao ducked behind the breakfast cart that was available for everyone to hid and feed Meng some sausage.

## Xi-Tao's Story

Wan-Tao began to tell everyone in the room what had happened to his little brother in between telling everyone all about barbaque rubs and briskets.

Xi-Tao told him that Gage had been putting pressure on him to work with some clients on a machine. Xi-Tao told him no multiple times because he hates Gage and told Gage to ask Brightpicker instead. 

Gage wasn't going to take no for an answer and became somewhat of a child stalker. It seemed like Xi-Tao would run into Gage all the time, even when he was delivering food to people around town. This eventually led to a fist fight between Xi-Tao and Gage that had to be broken up by the Murchadha Lumber guards. Because of Gage being Gage, he was able to charismatically convince the guards that Xi-Tao started the fight. 

This led to Xi-Tao being escorted home by the guards and having the guards explain to his parents about the fist fight that he started. Xi-Tao got grounded by his parents because of the fight and wasn't allowed to do anything but work at the family's barbaque place for a couple of weeks. During that time, Meng went missing. Xi-Tao's parents made an exception for his grounding punishment and let Xi-Tao look for Meng in the woods. 

One night while he was looking for Meng in the Gogashire Woods, he ran into Gage and a logger he recognized named Brent. Gage was holding tightly onto an injured Meng. Brent walked up to Xi-Tao and told him that he will help the Istrarian Dynasty with their mission and then accompany them back to their homeland where he would be set for life and given all the funding he needs along with room and board working as an artificer for the Istrarian Dynasty. 

Xi-Tao initially said no and began to beg Gage not to hurt Meng. Just then the Silent Man appeared out of nowhere carrying his older sister Yu-Tao who was in a deep sleep. The Silent Man laid Yu-Tao on the ground and pulled out a sword from his cane and placed it on her neck. Gage told Xi-Tao that he can say no again and Sy will slit your sister's throat. Or that he can say yes and Sy can take Yu-Tao back to her room where she will sleep "it off" safely, peacefully, and alive. 

Xi-Tao said that he'll do it and and asked Gage and Brent to let Meng and Yu-Tao go. Brent nodded and ordered the Silent Man to take Yu-Tao back to her room. The Silent Man once again disappeared. Gage walked up to Xi-Tao telling him that he made the right decision protecting his family. Xi-Tao then asked Gage to let Meng go, but Gage told Xi-Tao that Meng will stay with the Gray Suns as motivation. 

After that, Xi-Tao did whatever Brent and Gage ordered him to. Including stealing from the Omnipharmacon Apothecary and occasionally from Brightpicker's Repair Shop. Whenever they tested out the Mech Chet, Xi-Tao would adjust the settings accordingly and Gage would transport the Mech Chet to the appropriate location and activate it via timer. 

The overall plan was to test the Mech Chet then use it to the fullest extent on the day of King Thomas MacSual's memorial service. They were running behind because Xi-Tao was having a hard time grasping such advanced artificer concepts. However, the king passed later than expected for someone suffering from Spinebreak Disease, and Xi-Tao was able to catch up. 

They were working on the Mech Chet's final touches when the precession entered Elagdias. Some of the hardware broke a couple days ago and they ran out of BIF (Bolormite Imitation Fluid). Xi-Tao had to get Brightpicker to repair some of the gears and he had to break into the Omnipharmacon Apothecary to get more BIF ingredients. Unfortunately, Brent ended up being just as good with chemistry as him and they just needed to put the new hardware back in place. That's when the party interrupted the work. 

Xi-Tao had told him that he just knows that Brent was going to have him set the Mech Chet and Gage was going to place the Mech Chet at the Elagdias Church and set it on a timer. Xi-Tao wasn't entirely sure what all the Mech Chet can do and he never even heard of it until he was working on it with Gage and Brent. But after the Big Top incident yesterday, Xi-Tao knew that whatever the final plan was that it's not going to be good.
