# Session 35

## Adventure Prepping

Prior to going after the Stagmans, you all decided to prepare for the journey. Mellerel went to where Buy the Way used to be and got some additional supplies for the trip. 

Eeddi meanwhile continued to search for her pink coral. She eventually found her coral in the river behind the Murchadha Lumber Mill. When she pulled it out of the river, she saw that the coral was now green. Eeddi put her coral in a jar and went to find the others. 

Meanwhile, Jean and Garak went to investigate the house where Garak had found the letter in the trash can. The house where the letter was found was home to a young Trapper and his wife who had moved from the Hiano fleeing the famine. 

Garak began his incoherent speech about how he can offer his services and definitely be less discreet about our mission. Trapper's wife was super confused and worried until Jean took over and began to apologize for his companion and asked her about the painting that she had just pulled out of the rubble that had been their house.

Trapper's wife began to explain that she had painted it herself and it was the area of where they used to live before they flee the Hiano. She mentioned to Jean that she also constructed the frame. Unfortunately, the frame was damaged by the explosion and that she wasn't sure she'd be able to fix it. 

Jean then mended the picture frame and she thank him. He then walked over to the Trapper and began to talk to him. Trapper thanked him for helping out and told him that he and his wife will probably be forced to move due to the fact that they were poor to begin with and that all of his traps were destroyed. 

Jean then told Trapper not to worry too much about the traps and that he'll take care of it. Trapper thanked him and then he and Garak headed to Bob's Blacksmith. 

## Bob's Blacksmith

The party met back up together at Bob's Blacksmith. Jean paid for Bob to construct some more traps for Trapper. The party then asked Bob once again what happened with Danny and Bob told them the same thing. 

That he saw Danny heading towards the river seconds before the explosion. After the explosion, Danny got back up and walked through the now undead loggers and into the river. Danny wasn't coming up, so Bob jumped into save the boy. After Bob saved Danny, Danny ran off and Bob fought off the zombie loggers. 

Once the party finished talking to Bob, they headed out of Elagdias in search of the Stagmans.

## Stone Door

They party managed to find some giant snow capybara tracks and began to follow them. Shortly after leaving the town, the tracks leave the main road and into the Gogashire Woods. After a while, the trees start to thin a bit and you stumble upon a stone door that's slightly ajar in a rocky hill side. 

The party attempts to open the door, but the stone door is pretty heavy. After examining the stone door more, Eeddi was able to see that there was a set of stairs leading down into the dark. She threw a rock down the stairs, and heard it plop into water, but was unable to see it. 

After some debate, the party decides to mark the location on their map and come back to it. The party then continues on to catch up with the Stagmans. 

## Snow Capybara Tracks

You all continued on and come across more snow capybara tracks over the tracks that you were originally following. It looks like a herd of snow capybaras had passed over the tracks of the Stagmans snow capybaras. 

You managed to continue to track the tracks until you get to another wooded area. As you walked deeper into the woods, you began to hear braying of multiple snow capybaras and some unidentified growling.
