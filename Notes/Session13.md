# Session 13 #

## Garak ##

After the magic show, Garak went back to the Murchadha Lumber Mill and began to spread rumors about how the mushrooms are from the goddess of wild nature, Grelasis as punishment because of how the Murchadha family are treating nature poorly. 

Garak ran into Rick and told him about his theory. Rick was like "eh... That don't make no sense". They then started to talk about the street magic show that they saw over lunch. Garak said that he enjoyed it. Rick was like "eh. It's okay. Not a huge fan of nerds and nerdy stuff though".

Garak then continued to spread rumors about the mushrooms and eventually ran into the only survivor of Lumber Camp 44, a Dwarf named Brent. Brent had fought in the regular military of the Istrarian Dynasty against the Volquiria Kingdom in his younger days. 

He told Garak about how this ain't got nothing to do with divine rage, but just idiot loggers and foreman not listening to his instinct. One of the spruce trees had these tiny black mushrooms with red splotches that looked like blood. Brent had suggested that they burn this tree because what sort of mushroom grows in winter. The foreman didn't care and ordered the tree to be cut down.

Brent said that the second the loggers cut into the tree, a bunch of spores that seemed blood like puffed out and gigantic mushrooms began to consume everything where the spores fell to the ground. Brent managed to get away and told the Murchadha family what happened. 

Brent was the one that suggested to use fire too eliminate the blight, but after trying to burn it up with normal fire, they quickly realized that magical fire would be able to destroy the blight. Brent said that the Murchadha family sent a raven to a wizard name Ferguson (actually Friston) to come and rid the lumber camp of the mushrooms but they haven't heard back from him. After talking to Brent, Garak continued talk to people about how the mushrooms are our room!

## Eeddi ##

Eeddi returned back to Brightpicker's Repair Shop. Brightpicker was speaking to Almalia, the potion master of Elagdias's potion store called Omnipharmacon. She needed Brightpicker to repair a very used condenser so she can finish an order of healing potions that the Murchadha family had ordered. Almalia had explained that she was hoping to order a new condenser from Cormaig after she finishes the Murchadha family order. Brightpicker said that he'll try and get it to her tomorrow. 

Almalia thank him and told her that she'll have to pay Brightpicker later as the Murchadha family only paid her half and that got all the ingredients she needed, but nothing else. Brightpicker told her not to worry about it and to take her time. Eeddi then told Almalia that she understands. Almalia then said goodbye and left. 

Brightpicker asked if she got paid from the Murchadha family and she said yes and don't worry about it if they try to pay you again. Brightpicker said that he's not going to get payment twice even if most of the Murchadha family are jerks. 

Eeddi then gave him the hinge that Brightpicker had ordered and Brightpicker was super excited as he led Eeddi into the toy store area of his shop. Brightpicker screw the hinge into the front part of his toy train and explained that he wants to put something like a motor under the hinge to make the train move automatically. 

The door rang open and a customer came into the repair. She was a very unique customer. Dressed almost desert like garb of bronze robes and veil, the woman's brown eyes were the only physical trait that Brightpicker and Eeddi could see. She was speaking to Brightpicker in Giant. As Eeddi walked up, the bronze woman was asking if Brightpicker could repair something by this evening. Brightpicker said that he'd have to see what needs to be fixed before committing to a timeline. 

The bronze woman took out a small box and placed it on the table. She told them that she would pay triple if they can get it fixed tonight. Brightpicker then said that he needs to see what needs to repair. The woman open the small box to reveal a miniature version of the black sphere Eeddi saw in the party's dream that were surrounded by metal tubing, wire, and bars. Brightpicker's eyes widen in awe as he looked down at the device. He then told Eeddi to go repair Almalia's condenser. 

Eeddi tried to convince Brightpicker to let her stay, but he said no. She headed back to the workshop and pretended to be working on Almalia's condenser. She cast magic tinkering to make it sound like she was working and then sneak over to the door and tried to listen in on the conversation. Unfortunately, Brightpicker and the bronze woman were speaking in Quori which Eeddi didn't know. A few minutes later, an individual dressed in light desert bronze armor wearing a Roman mask walks into the shop. 

Eeddi watched as the bronze woman and Brightpicker converse, she realized that the bronze armorer was not saying anything. Instead, occasionally there would be a few seconds of silence while the bronze woman looks in the direction of her companion and then would turn towards Brightpicker and speak to him. 

After a few more minutes of conversing, the bronze woman and the bronze armorer left. Brightpicker then closed the box and put it into his cash safe behind the counter. Brightpicker then headed towards the workshop that Eeddi was in. She quickly dispel her magic tinkering and actually began to work on the condenser. 

Brightpicker told her that he's going to be out for a few hours and to watch the shop for him. He left and Eeddi immediately ran to the cash safe behind the counter. She began to mess with the cash safe and realized that she would need to have four different combinations in use them in the correct order to get the cash safe open. After that, Eeddi went back to working on Almalia's condenser. 

## Jean and Mellerel ##

Jean and Mellerel headed towards the Murchadha Lumber Store, which is basically Nebraska Furniture Mart. There were numerous signs pointing to various wooden products. Near the back of the store was a sign that said Hobbies. Feeling overwhelmed by all the wooden products surrounding them, Jean and Mellerel approached an halfling retail employee named Jilril Humblebee. As they walked up to her, she went from an expression of "this is so boring, I hate my job," to "I love my job let me show you some beautiful products we have" with a large fake smile.

Jean and Mellerel told her that they just need drumsticks. Jilril showed them to the Hobby section of the store and showed them a large wall with various size of drumsticks they can choose from. Since Socra played a bass drum, they got bass drumsticks. Jilril asked if they needed anything else and was really pushing for buying more stuff, but Jean and Mellerel said no. Jilril seemed a bit sad and frustrated, but she said okay and wrote her name on a sticker and put the sticker on one of the drumsticks. 

Jean and Mellerel went into the check out line and waited until they got to the front ignoring the knickknack sells man that sold a toy to the family in front of them. While they were waiting in line, Jean and Mellerel were trying to figure out how to get Jilril more commission then just selling drumsticks. When they got to the front, they saw Orilee and Baron Murchadha. Orilee was manning the register and Baron was waiting to be told when to carry heavy wooden products to the customers cart. Baron was wearing the trench coat that Danny was wearing earlier. 

Orilee greeted Jean and Mellerel warming and asked how they knew Eeddi. Jean and Mellerel said they met her in a dream and she just looked at them oddly and asked if that was all they needed. Jean and Mellerel said yes and handed Orilee the drumsticks. Orilee took Jilril Humblebee's sticker off the drumsticks and put it down in a notebook where she write down 2 bar chairs next to the sticker.

As Orilee opened the register, Jean and Mellerel noticed that there wasn't much money in the register. Orilee handed Jean and Mellerel the drumsticks and told them to say hi to Eeddi for her. As Jean and Mellerel were walking away, they heard Baron and Orilee conversing.

Baron was complaining about how he had to give some of his contraband ring money to cover for her register. Orilee told him to stop complaining and that if he didn't help her she would have told their father about his little contraband ring. Baron then fired back about how he would have told their father that she's manipulating the books. 

Jean and Mellerel then headed to the exit and began to think about what their street magic act was going to be.
