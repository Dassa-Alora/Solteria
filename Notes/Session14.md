# Session 14 #

## Garak ##

Garak continued to spread rumors about the killer mushrooms around the camp. As logging teams began to come back to the Lumber Mill and get ready to end the day, Garak noticed that Rick's team hadn't come back. 

Garak began to ask around for news on Rick and his team. He found out from Brent that Rick's lumber team accidentally encountered a deadly mushroom patch. Thankfully, no one was killed. Half of the team got cut off from the rest of the group. Rick's group had to go to the river and build a makeshift raft since they didn't want to hike 10 miles around the mushroom wall. 

The foreman in charge of Rick's team asked if they can use a boat to get the rest of the team. But Aron Murchada was like that's a waste of resources. So Rick's team is going to come back to the Lumber Mill super late. After that, Garak continued his rumor spreading. 

## Eeddi ##

Eeddi spent much of the morning going between trying to break into her boss's cash safe and apartment as well as fixing up Almalia's condenser. She finished fixing her condenser. Eeddi was determined to try to get into the cash safe and attempted to listen to the pins unlocking in the safe to figure out the combination. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to. 

Eeddi gave up on that for now and moved onto trying to break into Brightpicker's apartment. Once again, she unsuccessful locked pick the door and tried to find another way to get inside. She went outside and found a ladder. Eeddi then climbed up the ladder and attempted to break into the window under the guise of fixing stuff. 

Unfortunately, Eeddi roll low on her luck dice and Bob had caught her and asked why she was trying to break into Brightpicker's apartment. Eeddi attempted to convince Bob that she was looking for cracks to fix on the house, but Bob didn't buy it. 

Eeddi then talked to him about her really weird dream with the black humming sphere. Bob was all like that's super weird. Eeddi asked if he would be able to help her break into the cash safe and/or Brightpicker's apartment. Bob was like no. Eeddi then began to ask Bob how he got here. He told her that when he was 18 he moved out to Elgadias and opened the blacksmith shop here. Been here ever since. Eeddi then asked if Bob would like to borrow her book now since he was here. He said sure and Eeddi brought him "The Adventures of Palug the Goblin, Book 1". Bob said that Palug is such a fun series and thank her for letting him borrow it.

Eeddi then asked Bob if he can help her and Brightpicker out with the little train they were making. She explained that Brightpicker and her wanted to make the train move by itself around the track. Bob told her that he's not into children's toys. Eeddi managed to pursade him by saying the Palug books are children's books to which he said that they're at least Young Adult books.

Despite that, Bob agreed to look at the train and made some suggest on possible using wood or steam to have the train move by himself. Eeddi as Bob if he can help make an engine for that and Bob said that he'll have to think about it. He then said thanks and headed off to read Palug.

## Jean and Mellerel ##

Jean and Mellerel went back to their "troupe" camp just outside of Elagdias to get their stuff and pick up Scora for the street magic show. Jean threw the drumsticks at Scora and it also hit him in the face. Scora signed that he deserved that. Jean, Mellerel, and Scora got their stuff and then headed back into Elagdias.

As they walked into Elagdias, Danny (the mayor's son) and Ohanela (the oldest child of Almalia) were playing marbles. They saw the three carrying large items and asked what they were carrying. Jean and Mellerel said that it's for their magic show. The kids asked for a magic trick but they said that they should come to the magic show here in a bit. 

Jean and Mellerel then went to the town square where the twins and Trishana perform their magic show. Once the work day ended, Jean, Mellerel, and Scora began to perform their acts. The town loved it especially when the final act came about. 

Jean had Mellerel drink a "magical" potion which was actually only colored water. She then fell asleep and by using various illusionary skills had Mellerel sleeping in the air using a broomstick as a pillow. The crowd loved it and threw money in the hat. 

As Mellerel was waiting for Jean to pull her down, here eyes fell upon a dark wooden knot that was on the table below her. The dark knot seemed to began to spew out blackness and started to slowly consume her. Suddenly a splash of rainbow color shot out and stopped the darkness from flowing out of the wooden knot. Jean saw that Mellerel was beginning to get in distress and took her down. 

Just as they finished cleaning up, a large marching band suddenly arrived as circus actors performed around them. Bellindana's Big Top has arrived!
