# Session 39

## Journeying towards Cormaig

You all stood at the edge of the Asgardian River where Mellerel, Boggs, and the Stagmans just teleported to Cormaig. After a few minutes, Garak, Jean, and Mellerel decided to head towards Cormaig to finish escorting the Stagmans to the queen's ship at Cod Row. 

You all began to follow the river towards Cormaig. It's late afternoon, and it had begun to snow again. You all decided to make camp in a grove of trees near the river. The trees provided a great break against the wind and snow. 

After setting up camp, Eeddi began to play with her puzzle box leaning up against a pile of rocks. Garak began to roast questionable lizardfolk meat while Jean sat off a ways by himself fidgeting with one of his prop coins. 

After a bit, Eeddi walked up to Jean asking him what he was holding. Jean showed her the coin and did a few coin tricks that put a smile on her face. Eeddi then asked Jean if he was okay. Jean said that he was fine and that Mellerel was just his companion for the past few months and it's a bit weird without her being here. 

Eeddi told Jean that if he needed anything she's here for him. She then headed back to the rocks to play with her puzzle box when she suddenly stopped. Eeddi noticed that the rocks seemed to be shaped in a way that it couldn't be natural.  Eeddi took out a small artificer's hammer and hit the pile of rocks twelve times really fast. After the twelfth time, the rocks began to rise. 

## Enter Lock

The rocks weren't rocks at all, but metal that began to unfold and transform into a 10 foot tall automaton. The automaton's eyes glow red as he took in the campsite and the party members. 

The automaton's eyes turned green and asked what happened. The party answered by asking the same question to the automaton. The automaton attempted to find an answer in his mind matrices but the only thing he found was the word Lock, which kept popping up. 

The automaton answered that he had no idea what happened but it appears that his name was Lock. Eeddi was super excited and began to talk about how she only seen pictures and heard of Warforges in books before. She said that she's never seen any Warforges in real life. 

Eeddi then explains how Warforges are only found in the Isterian Dynasty and the Volquira Kingdom. She said that they're used as soldiers in the Eternal War. The party found a military insignia branded on his armor, but it has been scratched over by someone else. 

Eeddi told Lock that since they're going to Cormaig then they might be able to check out the library at Myrland Arcane Institute and look through some engineering and artificer books to see if they can determine if Lock was built by the Isterian Dynasty or the Volquira Kingdom. 

After that, Eeddi introduce Bevel and Atsi to Lock. She then saw that she was tired and will take third watch. Eeddi then settled down for the night and was out within 5 minutes. 

Lock was both mystified and nervous as he held the tiny little homunculus in his giant hand. He wasn't really sure what to do, but managed to carefully pet Bevel. 

Since the party was in the middle of the Myrland wilderness, they decided to take watches. Garak volunteered for the first watch, Jean volunteered for the second watch, and Eeddi volunteered for the third watch. 

## Garak's watch 

During Garak's watch, both he and Lock heard growling nearby. However, after a few minutes, the growling faded and Lock and Garak began to get to know each other. 

Garak explained to Lock that he was an acquirer of things that certain individuals needed to aquire under questionable circumstances. After that, Garak took out a lizardfolk arm full of lint and began to roast it over the fire. He also took out one of his dream bones and began to try and whittle a flute. 

Lock's fingers suddenly began to open up reveling multiple tools for various purposes. He then produced carving tools and Garak managed to whittle a pretty good bone flute before the hour of tools disappearing was up. Garak thank Lock for his tools and then woke Jean up for the second watch. 

## Jean's watch

Jean got up and sit with Lock. He wasn't really all there during his watch which was understandable given that one of his close friends left. While he was fidgeting with a magic prop, Lock looked over to the piecd of roasted lizardfolk arm lying on some rocks near the fire. Lock asked Jean if the meat arm was supposed to smell like that and Jean answered that he highly doubt it. 

Lock then asked Jean what he was fidgeting with. Jean explained to Lock that he was a performer and that our former companion was his assistant. Lock then asked what type of performer he was and Jean began to showcase some of his magic tricks. Lock thoroughly enjoyed watching Jean's tricks which caused Jean to perk up a little. 

Jean told Lock that he was glad he enjoyed his magic tricks and then went to wake Eeddi up for the third watch.
