# Session 2 (Short Arc) #

As you begin to investigate the back side of the church, Elraina seemed to have disappeared out of thin air. You began to investigate where Elraina was standing and it appeared that Elraina just have either blinked out of existence or had somehow managed to gain the power of flight and launch herself straight up into the night sky. 

## Church ##

After some conversing, Jean, Garak, and Mellerel decided that the best bet to find out what happened to Elraina is by gaining access to the inside of the church. Mellerel, Jean, and Garak began to examine the back door to the church. The same church symbol from the front door appeared on the back door with the letters K ~ G ~ G above it as Garak tried to opened it. He got frustrated with the door and attempted to punch the door. Garak crit fail at hitting the door and ended up elbowing Mellerel in the face as his fist was reflected back from the church's door. Eeddi on the other hand decided that Elraina must had turned exactly 180° and walk back exactly the way she came from the Memorial Garden making only one set of footsteps.

## Memorial Garden ## 

Eeddi arrives at the memorial garden and easily jumped over the waist high memorial wall. As she began to search the memorial garden for both letters and Elraina, she noticed that there was a large run down water fountain in the middle of the memorial garden. Eeddi approached the water fountain and saw that there was some sort of red-green algae looking goop in the water fountain. She decided that the best thing to do is to poke the red-green algae looking goop because you only live once right! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The second Eeddi touched the red-green algae looking goop it suddenly began to shudder and form into a dimwitted gloob of fleshy goop and attacked. Hearing that Eeddi was in trouble, Jean, Garak, and Mellerel rushed over to enter into combat against a gloopy glop goop who only wanted to be a volunteer in Jean's magic show. Unfortunately, Jean choose Garak to be the volunteer and together with Mellerel and Eeddi managed to defeat Mr. Gloop Glop Gloopy.

After the party defeats the goop, they begin to examine the hundreds of names on the Undying War Memorial using Eeddi's detect magic. You didn't see any other letters asides from the K that you all already found. After that, the party decided to check the storage shed that Garak described for the other two letters to gain access to the church. As the party heads around the back of the church towards the storage shed, you all spot an open grave.

## Open Grave ##

You arrive to an open grave and see that there is what appears to be a brand new coffin sitting six feet deep into the grave. Eeddi stated that she can see a purple light coming from what appears to be letters carved into the coffin's lid. Due to a dusting of snow on the coffin's lid, Garak had to climb down into the open grave and dust the snow off the coffin's lid to see the words "Free candy inside! Open me! :D" With the O glowing in Abyssal. Garak presses the O and then climbed out of the grave. The party then headed to the storage shed.

## Storage Shed ##

Jean, Garak, Mellerel, and Eeddi arrived at the storage shed where every now and then the chain, padlock, and door to the shed would shake violently. You all go to the window of the shed, but it is very grimy and dirty. Despite the dirtiness of the window, the party was able to see two shambling humanoid figures walking about. Garak was able to pop the storage shed window off the storage shed and Eeddi popped her head into the shed to see two undead humans shambling about as well as a glowing purple light in one of the corners. 

Eeddi decided to use some magicking tinkering on a bone that she took from the memorial water fountain and throw it into the shed distracting zombies with a holographic image of herself saying "Your storage shed warranty is about to expire. I'm contacting you to give you the opportunity to extend your shed's warranty." The zombies were easily distracted by the fact that they were in fact very interested in extending their shed's warranty as it was obvious that the storage shed was in need of repairs. Garak and Eeddi successfully managed to sneak into the storage shed without the zombies noticing and found a newly crafted tombstone that read "Braruil Graythane / 209 / I never thought I'd live to see this day! :D" with the Y in Graythane shining purple in Draconic. 

Eeddi pushed the Y while Garak grabbed a shove and the two jumped out of the storage shed and met back up with Jean and Mellerel. After Eeddi told the party that they activated the last letter, Mellerel took off sprinting towards the front of the church to get into the lit church building.

## Front door of the Church ##

As Mellerel runs up to the church's front door, she sees the same church symbol as before with the letters K Y G O G glowing above the symbol. Jean, Eeddi, and Garak joined up with her and began to examine the letters. Eeddi recalls that she had heard of a Gith folklore tale that Gith parents would tell their children that Kygog the Sculptor would come for them if they continue to misbehave. As Eeddi explained this to the party, Mellerel finally couldn't stand the darkness anymore and pushed the church doors open!
