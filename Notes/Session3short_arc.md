# Session 3 (Short Arc) #

The second the door of the church became unlocked, Mellerel burst through the door and into the entryway. Mellerel was running so fast that she almost collided with a suddenly reappeared Elraina. Thankfully for both Mellerel and Elraina, Mellerel suddenly disappeared before she plowed into Elraina. Elraina stood in the entryway for a few seconds confused about how she had suddenly appeared in the church's entryway and how Mellerel seemed to blinked out of existence. A second later, Jean and Garak walked into the church's entryway and as they walked over the threshold, the front door of the church slammed shut. It seemed that Mellerel and Eeddi had both disappeared when they entered the church.

## Church's Entryway ##

Jean, Garak, and Elraina began to explore the church's entryway. They saw a votive candle rack with some of the candles lit and some not. There was also a basin of Holy Water with a sign saying "Please take ONLY one vial of Holy Water. If you take more than one we will know!" There was also a stairway climbing upstairs behind a small expandable gate. The doors leading into the church proper had a stain glass mural of Dyius, the God of Birth and Renewal, and Enubus, Goddess of Peace, standing in the clouds above the earth. Upon the earth you have the various gods and goddesses who are good or neutral and below the earth are the evil aligned gods and goddesses. The party decided before going further into the church to wash their weapons in the Holy Water. As the dipped their weapons into the Holy Water they saw some of the drops float back into the Holy Water basins. Jean, Garak, and Elraina can now do radiant damage instead of their default damage for the next hour.

## Sanctuary ##

After some discussion, Jean, Garak, and Elraina decided to investigate further into the church. The door was unlock and as you open the door, you see that the church is packed with people. This came as somewhat of a shock and the group decided to investigate the patrons. As the group investigate the people, they realized that the people had noses and mouths, but no eyes. Jean stepped on the blue carpet that led up to the alter of the church where there was a large table with candles, the Solteria Scriptures, and the symbols of Dyius and Enubus. The second Jean stepped on the carpet the rows of people that he was nearest too put their hands up to their face palms out the revel eyes in their hands. Basically, the Pale Man from Pan's Labyrinth only humanoid like and not monster like.

Since the people didn't do anything aggressive, the party decided to investigate the alter. As Garak, Jean, and Elraina walked towards the alter, the people in the sanctuary would put their eye hands up and watch them as they passed. Once they got to the alter, they saw a man on the balcony of the alter with his back facing them. After some discussion and investigation, Elraina found the Holy Symbol of Rogbium, the God of Forests, and Garak, found the Holy Symbol of Bylios, the God of Craft. The group decided to check out the choir area that was on the sides of the alter and found a wooden door on each choir side, possibly leading out to the backside of the church. Garak picked the lock easily and opened the door. Inside was the door that you can assume leading back outside the back of the church and a staircase leading downstairs.

After some discussion on what to do, it was decided that Garak, Jean, and Elraina needed to confront the man up on the balcony to find out what's going on and to find out what happened to Eeddi and Mellerel. 

## Balcony ##

It was decided that the best way to approach this is by splitting up and have one person go up each of the three staircases that were in the back of the sanctuary and in the entryway. Elraina took the west staircase, Garak took the east staircase, and Jean went up the staircase in the entryway. 

Elraina and Garak walked up the staircase to see the man was facing straight ahead and not towards the two staircases. Elraina and Garak decided to sneak up on the Pale Man. Unfortunately, Garak failed at doing the one job he was supposed to do and got the Pale Man's attention. Garak suddenly hear a blood curling scream inside his mind as the Pale Man's eyes narrowed down on the Lizardfolk. Elraina succeeded in sneaks and wasn't seen. Jean was in the bell tower but managed to sprint back down and up to the balcony.
