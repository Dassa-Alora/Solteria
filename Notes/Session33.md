# Session 33

## Omnipharmacon

After getting your bearings, you realized that the Omnipharmacon was the area that needed the most immediate aid. Omnipharmacon is a mangled and melted mess. Some parts of the apothecary are one fire, other parts seemed to be frozen solid, still other parts seemed to be melting down into an ooze like substance. 

The party found that the Gith family survived. Oratig and his oldest son managed to get out of the collapsing store, but his wife and other children weren't as lucky. They were trapped in the storage room. Amalia and her daughter Ohana were using their weight to keep a melted glass shield up against the numerous alchemical reactions that were happening in the store. 

Through the means of a magical mechanical cat, growing glass support beams, and patting a toddler out of harms way, you all managed to rescue all members of the Omnipharmacon. After that, you helped put the chemical fire/reactions out by using a jar full of liquid that turns into foam when exposed to air. Once that was put out, you all decided to head to ground zero of the Mech Chet. 

## Dude, Where's the rod?

When you got there, you saw two loggers kicking something on the ground near a zombie. As you got closer, you realized that the two loggers were kicking a rod back and forth towards the zombie. When the rod got close to the zombie, the zombie would reanimate. But when the rod was kicked away from the zombie, it would unreanimate. 

The party pulled their writ card and told the loggers that they have jurisdiction over this area. The loggers kicked the rod over to the party warning them that it was hot. It was indeed hot. Garak used his spare leather armor to securely wrap the rod in it and Mellerel brought over a bucket of water to toss it in. Eeddi had cast detect magic and saw that it was glowing green before the water had cooled and put the magic color out.

The rod feels and looks like it's made out of lead, but the weight of a solid lead pipe is heavy. Eeddi examined the rod and figured out that the rod was hollow and that there was something loose in the rod. 

Eeddi also found the girl's purse that she lost when they dragged her back through the portal. Inside the girl's purse was alchemist supplies, tinker's tools, a notepad with alchemical and artificer equations on it, the diagram of the Mech Chet, entitled Project 237 again, and a small scroll with a list of eleven names. Eeddi recognized two of the eleven names. 

1. Patriarch Raungek, ruler of the Istrian Dynasty (Everyone, Male Lich)
2. Qhauben, master scientist for the Istrian Dynasty (Eeddi only, Male Lich)
3. Rimi Vondrim
4. Jien Sieng
5. Torlana Birchguard
6. Vhut'zig
7. Zhuduk The Idiot
8. Snok 
9. Shaddeq
10. Dradala
11. Kelwin Deepsteel

After examining all articles that were found, the party then decided to go talk to Bob about the rod.
