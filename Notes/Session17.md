# Session 17 #

## Countess Bellindana's Big Top ##

After combat ended, Countess Bellindana was angry that the pranksters targeted her circus and was looking for someone to pay. She saw Mellerel and Jean and began to accuse them of causing the whole incident. 

The little girl, Ceanna, then came to the party's defense and said that they helped her and the other carnival goers. Bellindana was like "The adults are talking, stay out of this, here's some more carnival tickets."

Lord Protector Drift was all like "You do not talk to the Queen like that." Bellindana then apologize to Queen Ceanna. After that, Lord Mayor Katrin and some of the Murchadha family guards arrived on the scene. 

Katrin then asked what happened and Bellindana began giving Katrin an ear full of how dare this happened at her carnival. Katrin then told Bellindana about the pranks and she got even angrier because Katrin didn't mention it. Katrin assumed that the pranksters wouldn't dare prank Countess Bellindana's Big Top since it was the largest carnival in the world and already had a ton of security. 

After some more arguing, Bellindana left and Lord Mayor Katrin ordered the Murchada family guards to bring Baron Murchada to her home for questioning. 

After that, the party began to investigate the area to see if there was anything around that could have caused this. Garak found a hexagonal imprint on the ground in the middle of where the animal big top was. The imprint had some gears on it. Garak had no idea what it was and sketch the imprint. 

Eeddi then came up and was like "Looks kinda like that machine that those weird Metal Ones left with us for Brightpicker to repair." Eeddi then asked the party if they can break into her boss's safe.

## Brightpicker's Shop ##

On the way to Brightpicker's Repair Shop, the party passed by Baron, Aron, and a few Murchadha family guards who were in the process of arresting him. The party continued onto Brightpicker's Repair Shop. 

When they got there, the store's lights were on. Eeddi was like "I thought I locked it ". Meanwhile, Jean walked into the shop because "If the lights are on and the door's unlocked then the shop's open."

The party walked into the store and Eeddi was like "Brightpicker you here?" They heard some noises in the workshop which the door was cracked open with some light coming through. 

Brightpicker came out of the workshop and he looked exhausted. Like he hasn't slept for days exhausted, except he was only out for like six hours. He told the party that the store was closed and asked Eeddi to please go to bed. 

The party (mostly Jean) tried to blackmail Brightpicker saying that they're going to get the guards since the machine that Eeddi claimed Brightpicker was fixing was the possible cause of the animal incident. Brightpicker said that the device has been in the cash safe. Jean said that anyone could break into his shop and steal it while he was out and Eeddi was at the carnival. 

Brightpicker said that the party is welcome to try and break into it. He then went back into his workshop. The party attempted to break into it but couldn't. Garak then realized that the cash safe is designed like the Treasury safes of royalty, only it's a smaller version. 

Brightpicker then told the group to leave and come back for breakfast and he'll tell them some stuff that might help find the pranksters. Eeddi then asked if the party can spend the night. Brightpicker was like whatever and went back to the workshop. 

Eeddi showed the party to the basement where they could stay for the night. Eeddi told the party that they might need to shake out the blankets because spiders could be wintering there. Mellerel was all like, "I'll just sleep on the stairs." The party said good night.
