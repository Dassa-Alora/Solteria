# Session 11

## Pranksters

Lord Mayor Katrin asked Garak, Jean, Mellerel, and Rowena what their stories were. 

Garak explained how he used to work as an entrepreneur doing interesting jobs, but it didn't pan out. So he came around here and decided to sign on as a logger when the money was running low. 

Rowena explained how she literally drew the short stick and had come into town to get supplies for her and her fellow ranger friends. She also said that she's always up for free food. 

Mellerel explained how she has been on a journey for searching for sunny countries and also been accompanying Jean as they are following the Royal Precession. 

At that, Lord Mayor Katrin told them that it should be good time remembering King Thomas. Hopefully, no pranks will occur. The party inquire more about these pranks that have been happening. 

Katrin told the party that someone have been playing pranks at the numerous festivals that Elagdias has for throughout the year. Recently though the pranks have been getting out of hand. She told them that one prank someone released a bunch of dead pigs that were flying around and bumping into the townsfolk that were attending. The most recent incident happened a couple of months ago during her birthday celebration. 

Because Elagdias is a small town (asides from the loggers on the Murchadha family side of Elagdias). They're able to have festivals where anyone can help themselves to food and games for free. Gruug and Gage had created a very beautiful coral reef cake with various sea life sculpted on. She knew that it wasn't Gruug or Gage that had done the prank because she had even lick the batter as they were making the cake. 

Anyway since it was the Lord Mayor's birthday, she got to eat the first bite of cake. Somehow someone had used magic to make the cake taste like rotting fish. Before she was able to warn the townsfolk not to eat the cake, they ate some. Many spit the cake out though some actually vomit. Gage and Gruug were super ticked and they ended up serving the townsfolk pastries that were slated for tomorrow. 

Katrin told the group hopefully they won't have any issues with King Thomas's Precession and with Countess Bellindana's Big Top. Especially since the Big Top has a ton of security personnel. Katrin then asked Jean why he was in town.

## Magic Madness

Jean told the Lord Mayor Katrin that he and Mellerel were trying to keep ahead of Countess Bellindana's Big Top so that the townsfolk could see some real street magic. Lord Mayor told Jean that she has seen street magicians before and they had some of the best tricks she's ever seen. Though street magicians could sometimes be a little mad. 

Jean told Lord Mayor that madness is part of a street magician's life. Katrin then asked what kind of madness had Jean brought to the table. Jean then asked if she had 3 opaque whiskey glasses. 

Katrin said of course and Gruug came in and asked if anyone wanted anything in it. Jean said no that he just needed 3 opaque whiskey glasses. Eeddi then asked if she could have some bourbon. Gruug was all like of course. A few minutes later, Gruug came back from the kitchen with 4 glasses, 1 with bourbon that he gave to Eeddi and 3 empty glasses that he gave to Jean. 

Jean turned the glasses over and then took a couple of napkins and waded them up into little balls and put each napkin balls on the the glass's bottom. He then produce a wand and pick up a ball and tapped the wand on his hand making each napkin ball disappear. Then he turn the glasses over and revealed that each of the napkin balls were under the cups. Everyone enjoyed the trick. Katrin was super impressed. Gruug gave Jean a"good one" smirk and leaned down to Jean and told him "Good trick. I trick myself when I was young." 

Gruug then asked if he could get anything else for anyone. Everyone said no. Gruug then got excited and declared that he has made a home culture dessert. Lord Mayor Katrin along with everyone else was like "yay..." 

A few minutes later, Gruug came out of the kitchen carrying a large creature that he called the Tessox. It looked like a mound of black rotting flesh with numerous eyes all around it and tentacles protruding out from the bottom part of the mound. Everyone was super disgusted by the dessert until Gruug began to slice everyone a piece. The dessert ended up being a artistic cake representation of a creature of Gith legend called Tessox. Gruug then told the party the legend of Tessox. 

## Tessox

It was said that long ago the Tessox fell through the sky from the Beyond. Tessox fell into the Deep and sunk into the abyss of the Deep. Tessox then opened a portable from the Beyond that infected the Deep with the Shroud. It's said that monsters of incompressible horror lurks beyond the Shroud and any ships that tries to enter the Shroud immediately get swallowed up by the dark fog the second the bow touches the Shroud. Tessox is supposedly the one that keeps the Shroud in existence. 

## Other Shroud Theories

With the history checks, you all know that there's numerous legends and stories of how the Shroud of the Shrouded Deep came to be. The Shroud is a thick black fog that sets motionless 20 miles off all coasts that touches the Shrouded Deep. The Shroud has existed from before recorded history. Ships that have tried to enter the Shroud has been immediately grabbed by the Shroud the second the ship's bow touches the Shroud. 

The weather of the coasts that touches the Shroud Deep is extremely unpredictable and very dangerous. This is because the Shroud obscures all storms from view until the storm comes within 20 miles of the coasts. 

About 50 years ago, a small group of graduate students and two professors from the Myrland Arcane Institute and Rylia Academy of Magics traveled to coasts of Mryland and Rylia during the summer time to test a magically infused type of concrete called gripple, a mixture of the magical gem Hyalasium and concrete. They built two bare bones gripple houses. The next summer when they returned to record the structural integrity of gripple houses after the stormy season, they were surprised that despite the outside of the buildings being worst for wear, they interior of the houses were completely untouched.

Until recently, the coasts of all the countries were mostly uninhibited with the exception of the summer months when the weather is calm. After the creation of gripple, small fishing villages, as well as controversial AAA fishing camps, began to pop up along the coasts of the countries bordering the Shrouded Deep. The weather on the coasts of the Shrouded Deep is still dangerous and unpredictable, but gripple has opened the Shrouded Deep coasts up for year round villages. 

With the Arcana check, many in magical academia believe that the Shroud is the result of war of magic between two kingdoms long ago. The main theory is that the Shroud is an affect from a large magical weapon. A much rarer theory for the Shroud is that the more "benevolent" kingdom had created the Shroud to keep the rest of Solteria safe from magical war that is still occuring. Though that doesn't explain why ships are swallowed up by the Shroud. Perhaps the kingdom needs more soldiers for their war...

## Foyer Museum

After lunch, Lord Mayor Katrin invited the party to stay as long as they want in the foyer's museum. Katrin then got up and headed out to do more work for King Thomas Royal Precession coming into town. Elraina followed her and Elise was left in the dining room with these weirdos. She told them to enjoy the museum and got up to follow Elraina. The second Elise left the room. Rowena completely forgot anything about Baron, Danny, and Elise's contraband ring and was as far as she was aware just randomly invited to lunch while asking where the town's general store was. 

The party then headed out to the foyer to check out the museum. They checked out the unusual pink coral that was on display. The sign red in big letters DON'T NOT TOUCH IF TOUCH GET A CLERIC IMMEDIATELY. Below that was an explanation of how the pink coral came into Lord Mayor Katrin's possession. 

The Lord Mayor Katrin had taken her annual summer trip to the Myrland coasts. One day while her and her house were playing on the beach, a two year old Danny found the pink coral and picked it up. The second he picked it up, Danny became extremely confused and unable to remember who or what he was. Danny then toddled out into the ocean and was nearly swept out to sea. Gruug had managed to save the boy who was still clutching the pink coral. It took many people to try to keep Danny from running back out to the ocean and to get him to let go of the pink and now glowing coral. By the time they managed to subdued Danny they had suspected that the coral was the cause of Danny's sudden madness, mainly because it was glowing. 

The summer trip was cut short and Danny was taking to a Cleric in the closest town. Unfortunately, the Cleric was unable to do anything to help Danny and sent them to Baolanach, the capital of Myrland to see a Cleric that specialized in Mind Afflictions. Danny was eventually admitted to the hospital where he spent about 3 weeks stuck in a maddening state. After a few weeks, Danny was back to his normal self much to Katrin and her house relief. 

After reading this, Eeddi had a great idea to steal the pink coral using a napkin to keep it from touching her skin. Eeddi managed to steal the coral without getting noticed. As she put the pink coral in her pocket, it felt nice and warm and comfortable and she really wants to take the coral out of the napkin and just snuggle up with the nice warm coral.

After a few more minutes looking around, the party left the Lord Mayor's mansion. As they began to walk into the town, Mellerel and Jean heard a familiar voice. "Come one and come all to the marvelous magic of Matthew the Mattgician!" Soon a group of townsfolk that had been out and about during the lunch rush hour began to gather around Matt and Trishana who began to play a wooden flute and cast druidic magic to gain the attention of others.
