# Session 38

## Sleds

You all constructed somewhat average sleds to transport the Stagmans to the closest actual city Baolanach. During the night while everyone was asleep but Jean, he saw a large round pitch black circle that seemed to be floating in the white night snowy sky. 

It was heading due west and was moving silently. The best Jean could tell was that the black silent shape flying in the sky was an airship. Once the sleds were completed, the group put the Stagmans on the sleds and began the trek down southeastern to Baolanach. 

## The Trappers 

As the party continued through the snowy landscape towards Baolanach, you all come across a small group of trappers hiking along the Asgardian River. You guys followed them for a while to see if they had enough resources to help the Stagmans. 

After following them for a bit, you realized that the Trappers were basically Back-country trapping/hiking. So they probably had a first aid kit on each of them and maybe one healer kit among all of them. 

## The Asgardian River

You guys left the Trappers and headed towards the Asgardian River. You guys arrived to the riverbank and decided to try and cross the river. Yu-Tao managed navigate a way across the ice to get up to the edge of the river. 

After some discussion, the party decided that crossing the river was too dangerous and decided to go to the bridge that was located about 10 miles downstream. 

As you all were walking, Mellerel spotted a terrifying creature standing at the bank of the river. The creature was tall and gray colored. It looked pretty emancipated and had black eyes and pointed teeth. The creature began to walk slowly towards Mellerel before it seemingly disappeared as a giant tortle wizard popped his head out from the Asgardian River. 

The tortle shouted out Mellerel's name and Mellerel was all like Boggs. Boggs come out of the river and walked up to the group. Mellerel introduced the party to her friend Boggs who she had hung out with while she was traveling through the desert country Ocumiel. 

Boggs told the group that he used to work as a detective in Ocumiel and then retired to travel the world and that's how he met Mellerel. You asked Boggs if he can help you out with healing the Stagmans from the pox. He told you that he wasn't apt at healing, but he can teleport to someplace. 

The party asked if he could teleport the family to Baolanach and then you can meet the family there. Boggs told you that he never been to Baolanach and asked if the party can describe it for him. You attempted to describe what Baolanach was like but Boggs was all like I don't think I can teleport everyone confidently there. 

The party asked where he had been in Myrland and Boggs said he had been to Cormaig and can for sure teleport the family there. Boggs asked Mellerel if she wanted to go with him and Mellerel was like sure. 

You all said goodbye to Mellerel, the Stagmans, and Boggs. They then teleported away. Now it's just Eeddi, Garak, and Jean alone in the snowy landscape of middle Myrland.
