# Session 15 #

## Parade and Dinner ## 

As the party begin to help Jean and Mellerel pack up their magic props, Countess Bellindana's Big Top arrived in town. A large and loud marching band began to march into town. Performs from magicians to clowns to acrobats awed the people of Elagdias. At the end of the parade, being pulled by to large elephants in a huge carriage was an elven woman, Countess Bellindana. 

She gave a "rousing" speech about how she and her troupe have come to celebrate King Thomas MacSual's life and to bring joy to the people of Elagdias. Bellindana then "kindly" asked everyone to move out of the street. 

As the townsfolk began to move off the street, a sleek black carriage carrying a eight year old girl and a older middle aged man pulling a glass coffin with the deceased King Thomas MacSual. The party bowed in respect. 

Eeddi then invited everyone to Xybi's Tree Pub for dinner and the rest of the party was like why not. On the way to Xybi's Tree Pub, Eeddi dropped off Amalia's potion condenser. She invited Eeddi and her friends to dinner, but the mere smell of a "rotting fish corpse" made stomach churn. But the dessert looked amazing. Eeddi and company politely decline and then headed off to Xybi's Tree Pub. 

Xybi's Tree Pub is located within a large spruce tree. Once inside you come across a chalkboard that has various classified ads tape to it. There's also some fancy chalk calligraphy that said "Guess the Riddle of the Day and get a free drink." With the Riddle of the Day being "What can you cut at the table but never eat?"

The party gave some good guesses with Eeddi's guess of check being the closest but not the answer that Xybi was looking for. They also got some more additional details about the pranks that have been happening at Elagdias town events. The number one "suspect" is Baron Murchadha, the youngest son of the Murchadha family. But Xybi and the rest of the townsfolk are pretty sure it wasn't Baron. It was just something that Baron would think about doing. But even if he did, the magic that is used in the pranks are way beyond what a teenage elf could do. After a bit, the party had dinner. After dinner, you guys head to the line that gives you access to Countess Bellindana's Big Top. 

## Countess Bellindana's Big Top ##

You guys wait in line to buy tickets to gain entry into the carnival. When you make it to the front of the line, you see some very accurate sketches of Trishana, Sara, Matt, Socra, Mellerel, and Jean taped next to the ticketmaster's window. The poor little gnome looked at the sketches, looked at Jean and Mellerel, and just shrugged saying whatever and don't let them know that he let you guys in. The party paid the appropriate ticket purchase amount and went into the carnival. 

The party acted mostly like backup for Jean and Mellerel who "trespassed" into the carnival to perform some fun magic tricks. Rus an Aarakorca security guard was the first to stumble upon the groups and was like "hey you're not supposed to be here" rather melancholy. Eeddi managed to use fast talk to get to know Rus.

Rus had signed onto Countess Bellindana's Big Top because he wanted to be in the high flying acts. Rus was supposedly one of the best Cliffriders in Kreslavia. Unfortunately, he didn't make the cut and wound up as being a security guard. Eeddi and Rus continued to talk and Eeddi gave him some alcohol so Rus can "forget" about Jean and Mellerel. Jean and Mellerel were successfully able to continue doing tricks for the carnival-goers.  

A few minutes later, the party sees Bob, who seems to be wearing a large black padded "knight's" helmet with ear muffs, pulling a large wagon full of various carnival game winnings as well as a very large bag of what you can assume is gold. Bob was being escorted by five large security guards out of the carnival.

He catches Eeddi's eye and bent down to tie his shoe. When Bob stood back up and continued on, Eeddi had seen that Bob dropped a small orange googly eye tabby cat toy that he had won from the carnival games. Eeddi picked it up and shook it. The googly cat began to make some fun carnival music and then stop. Eeddi put it in her pocket to give back to Bob later.

Unfortunately after a bit, Jean and Mellerel got caught by a security guard who did like his job and chased the party. Eeddi managed to push Rus towards the security guard saying that his friend is a little tipsy. The security guard cursed and began to help Rus towards the carnival worker tents. The security guard told Jean and Mellerel to leave before he gets back. 

A few minutes after that took place, the party suddenly heard screaming coming towards the large big tops in the center of the carnival. The party watched as the animal Big Top began to rise high in the sky like a hot air balloon exposing a crowd of people, animal tamers, and a lion, elephant, and gorilla beneath it. Once the hot air balloon big top was high enough, it exploded into hundreds of fireworks.
