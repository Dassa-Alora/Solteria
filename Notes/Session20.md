# Session 20

## Brightpicker's Repair Shop

Since it was getting close to lunch time, the party decided to head back to Brightpicker's Repair Shop and see if they can eavesdrop/listen for the conversation between the Metal Ones and Brightpicker. 

When the party arrived, Brightpicker was already discussing with the Bronze Woman in Quori. Garak, Jean, and Mellerel pretend to be customers while Eeddi went to a pile of appliances and began working on repairing one. 

Garak began to whistle and walked as nonchalantly as possible to the door to Eeddi's room. He attempted to open it sneakily, but his whistling caused Brightpicker and the Bronze Woman to just watch judging Garak harshly. Eeddi's door was locked and Brightpicker told Garak that everything for sell is on the floor. 

Garak thank Brightpicker for this revelation and began to browse the store. After a few more minutes of conversing, Brightpicker and the Bronze Woman went into the workshop. Brightpicker told Eeddi that she was in charge. Brightpicker locked the door and the party went into action. 

Garak attempted to break into the cash safe behind the counter. Jean drank a glass of water and walked up to the door and used the glass as a sound magnifier. Eeddi went into her room and listen to the conversation through the vent. Mellerel stood behind the counter and watched for anyone coming into the store. 

Eeddi put her ear up to the vent and was able to hear Brightpicker and the Bronze Woman talking. A few minutes later Eeddi heard a whoosh and heard a third male voice speaking in Quori. Jean was able to hear muffled voices conversing but wasn't able to pick up the whoosh and the third voice. 

Garak continued to try to work on the cash safe, but wasn't able to get it open. Eeddi and Jean continued to listen in. Suddenly, they both hear something metal and something glass being put on the workbench. After a few more seconds of silence, both Eeddi and Jean heard the sound of low humming and nothing else. 

Jean asked Garak if he could lock pick the door and Garak said that he can try. Garak attempted to lock pick the door while Eeddi joined them. Mellerel was watching the party try to lock pick the workshop door when she heard the tinkering of a bell. 

Horrified, Jean and Eeddi crowded around Garak who was still trying to open the door while Mellerel turned to see who it was. A 16 year old boy, came walking in and angrily said aloud "This is so stupid." He walked up to the counter and asked Mellerel if his order was done yet. 

Mellerel frantically began to go through the counter doors looking for orders. She asked who it was for and the boy said that it was under the name Xi-Tao Stagmane. Mellerel managed to find a drawer that had finished, in process, and waiting orders. 

She panicky looked through the forms and thankfully found Xi-Tao's order. The order was small enough to be stapled to the order form. It appeared that Xi-Tao had requested Brightpicker to repair two small custom gears and two small screws. Mellerel handled Xi-Tao his order. 

Xi-Tao then threw 5 gold coins onto the counter, said thanks, and angrily marched out the door literally not caring about what Jean, Eeddi, and Garak were doing. Mellerel breathed a deep sigh of relief and went back to watching the party try to lock pick Brightpicker's workshop door. 

After failing to lock pick the workshop's door, Eeddi said that she has a key and opened the workshop's door. Eeddi opened the door and there was no one there. Asides from the tools and projects being scattered around the workshop, there were no one in the shop. 

There was a circular glass orb sitting at the edge of the workbench. Eeddi investigated the orb. She cast detect magic and saw that the snow globe was emitting light blue magic as well as creating a light blue shield that's a 10 feet by 10 feet sphere around the workbench. Eeddi was able to see 3 foggy humanoid figures moving within the sphere that surrounded the workbench. 

After more investigating, Eeddi discovered that the snow globe had a small red shard of Bolormite in it. The humming was being caused by the Bolormite shard that was emitting a magical frequency that was causing the glass orb to vibrate creating the humming noise. Eeddi also recognized the spell that was imbued into the Bolormite shard as "Private Sanctum". Since nothing is able to get through or come out and since Eeddi had enough wisdom not to poke the magical device, Eeddi left the workshop and informed what she found out. 

Bolormite is a crystal that is found on the southern continent of Syrelion. Bolormite rarely leaves Syrelion as it's a highly controlled magic source and many of the countries in Syrelion has the resources to harness power and spells into small Bolormite crystal shards. The only two countries on the northern continent, Nuryu, that have minimal amounts of Bolormite are the Istrarian Dynasty and the Volquiria Kingdom, which has been at war with each other for hundreds of years. 

After some discussing, the party decides to go to the Omnipharmacon Apothecary and ask Oratig about his hexagonal metal plates. 

## The Omnipharmacon Apothecary

The party left Brightpicker's Repair Shop since there was nothing more they can do and head to the Omnipharmacon Apothecary. When they arrive, they were greeted by a four year old Gith girl playing in a playpen with her younger brothers.  She pointed the group towards mama and papa and the party made their way to the back of the store. 

Once you got to the front, you saw four Giths, a man, a woman, and two school aged children crafting healing potions. After some small talk which included Garak asking for a potion where he can break into places, Jean asked Oratig about his hexagonal metal plates. Oratig explained how the metal plates are used as splash pads for the potion making process. 

Mellerel asked why does it have to be hexagonal and not circular. Oratig then explained how the more angles that is present in Gith cultural, the more luck and favor they will receive from the gods. He then says that he even has an octagonal splash pad, but he's saving that for the more complex potions. Oratig's opinions on pentagons is meh.

Jean then explained how someone had used a hexagonal plate to break through the fence of Countess Bellindana's Big Top yesterday and that they were here to investigate. Oratig said that they're welcome to search the inventory but that they just did their weekly inventory check the other day and nothing was missing. Oratig then sent his oldest child, Ohana with the party to show them the plates. 

While the party was going into the inventory room, Mellerel stopped as it was pretty dark. Ohana lit up an oil lamp and lead the party into the room. Mellerel froze as the oil lamp cast ominous shadows of the inventory throughout the room. The shadows began to coalesce into a black spider shape shadow. Mellerel was able to shake off the darkness and cast dancing lights to illuminate the room. Mellerel then followed the rest of the party into the inventory room.

She showed them that they had 2 plates left and confirmed that the order form that they use as a tracker verified it. Mellerel and Jean asked if they can pick the plates up and she said sure but be careful because they're very heavy. Mellerel managed to slowly pull the metal plate off of the shelf. 

The hexagonal metal plate was indeed heavy and crashed vertically on the ground. Thankfully, Mellerel was able to prevent the plate from falling flat on the floor by leaning on it. Jean then went to slide the last plate off of the shelf only to find that he was able to easily lift the plate over his head. 

Ohana stated that isn't right and that the plate should be very heavy. Jean then took out the knife and began to scratch up the plate only to find that the plate was a well disguised wooden replica of the hexagonal metal plate. 

Ohana went to get her father and he came into the inventory room to see what was going on. The party explained how the metal plate was a fake and that someone switched it with a very well disguised replica. Oratig was pissed and took the replica and tossed it out of the inventory room. The party, Oratig, and Ohana went to check out the backdoor of the inventory room. Although it was very subtle, Garak was able to see evidence that the door has been broken into multiple times. 

Oratig walked out the inventory room telling you that he's going to report the break ins to the mayor and told Ohana to stick with them. You guys then hear Oratig and Amalia speaking in Gith in angry tones. You guys then hear the front door open and slam shut. 

Mellerel then said that we should probably check the rest of the inventory. Eeddi and Garak were stoked to touch all the things. Ohana told the party to wait a second and don't touch anything yet. Ohana then walked out of the room and the party was heard Ohana telling her mom that they need to redo the inventory. 

Amalia said that she'll help with the inventory and that Ohana and Rimloth should continue to make the massive order of healing potions for the Murchadha Lumber Mill. Ohana started to argue, but her mom told her to just follow instructions. 

Amalia then came into the inventory room and handed the party each a pair of thick rubber gloves. She then looked at Mellerel seeing that she's the most responsible one and said that she is going to help her account for the potion ingredients. Garak and Eeddi were told to check out all the potion making equipment. Jean was assigned to check each of the glass vials, beakers, test tubes, etc for anything out of the ordinary.
