# Session 18 #

## Breakfast at Brightpicker's ##

The party wakes up to Eeddi coming down the stairs into the basement. She says that she has breakfast stuff and you all follow her upstairs. Eeddi makes everyone breakfast and the party chats about how they are going to discuss this odd mechanical imprint with Brightpicker. Eeddi insured the group that Brightpicker can 100% be trusted. After the group finishes breakfast, Brightpicker still hasn't come out of his workshop. Eeddi looks around at the group and says that she's going to go get Brightpicker. As Eeddi goes to get Brightpicker, Jean cast silent image to make the cash safe look like they had managed to get it open.

Eeddi knocks on the door and you all heard the sound of clanging and banging as if someone had fell asleep while working. After a few minutes, the door opened and a tired Brightpicker popped out of his workshop. Brightpicker sighed seeing how it was morning and was hoping against hope that you had all left. He goes back into his workshop and the group hears a low mechanical humming for a few minutes that is much different than the humming from the black sphere in you dreams. A few minutes later, Brightpicker brings out a much larger metal plate with numerous gears and switches and mechanical things on it. Brightpicker and Eeddi then headed back to the kitchenette where the rest of the party was.

## Mechinus Chariots (Mech Chets) ##

As Brightpicker was walking towards the kitchenette, he saw that the safe was opened, and nonchalantly said "Didn't think you can open it." 

Brightpicker then showed the party a hexagonal mechanical plate that is at least twice the size of the imprint that Garak drew. Garak placed his drawing on the table. Brightpicker took one look at Garak's drawing and then said, "That this is shoddy work and whoever is trying to make one of these homemade is going to blow up all of Elagdias and then some."

Brightpicker then began to explain how his clients had requested that he repairs this device. The device is called Mechinus Chariots but they call it Mech Chets for short. Brightpicker explains how this machine can do anything and that the Mech Chets designed are secretly guarded. He explains how this technology isn't even present on this continent, which is Nuryu. Brightpicker then tells the party that this technology was created in the southern continent, which is called Syrelion. Brightpicker refused to tell you what the country of origin for these machines are, but you can deduce that this technology can come from three of the five countries located in Syrelion. The possible countries in Syrelion where these Mech Chets could come from are Kraytion, the Laisora Republic, and the Shezian Domain. 

Brightpicker then begins to tell the group that the clients are part of a group called the Metal Ones. The Metal Ones are supposedly a secret society that does secret society things. It's assume that there are multiple Metal Ones, though the the only Metal One that has been identified and confirmed is the Influencer of Iron who is an advisor in Count Dimitri von Schildenfeld's court in Kreslavia. The clients that had requested to repair the Mech Chet is presumably the Bronze One based on their armor though Brightpicker doesn't know their title.

The party then theorized to Brightpicker that they think that the pranksters are using one of these Mech Chets for their pranks. Brightpicker tells them that it would be nearly impossible to get a power source this far north. When the party asked about the power source and if the can see it, Brightpicker said no and that his clients have the power source. The power source is much more guarded then the actual Mech Chet device. He tells the group that it might be possible to get a power source if the pranksters were state sponsor. 

Brightpicker then said if the party thinks they can get away with it, they can come back at around noon and listen to the humming noise that the machine makes. Brightpicker suggested that the party should talk to Bob about their Mech Chet drawing. The man is weirdly good with patterns and might be able to put something together in his mind from past orders he had received. Mellerel and Jean then suggested on talking to Orilee Murchadha. Brightpicker told the group that he wouldn't trust anyone in the Murchadha family, though he can't stop you all from talking to them.    

## The Plan ##

The party plans on talking to Bob first and then speaking to Orilee. Afterwards, they plan on going back to Brightpicker's Repair Shop to listen to what sound the Mech Chet makes.
