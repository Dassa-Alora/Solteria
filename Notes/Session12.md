# Session 12 #

## Magic show ##

The group walks out the Lord Mayor's courtyard and immediately ran into Matthew the Mattgician and Trishana who was about to put on a street magic show for the lunch rush hour crowd of Elagdias. 

Trishana began to play her wooden flute and cast druidic magic to set the mood. Roots began to emerge from the snowy ground and Trishana began to use her magic to create a tangle of roots that she used as steps to dance around. 

Matt announced who he and Trishana were and told the group that he has a co-magician with him, his sister Sara but he hasn't been able to find her. Matt shouted Sara's name and began to look around the crowd. Matt then said that he needs a volunteer and pointed to Danny who was wearing a trench coat. Matt asked Danny to come up here. 

Danny seemed pretty nervous, but after the crowd peer pressuring him, Danny reluctantly walked up to Matt. Matt asked if he could borrow Danny's trench coat for a minute. Danny was super reluctant but after glancing at Baron, who didn't seemed worried Danny ended up handing Matt his trenchcoat.

Matt shook out Danny's trench coat and asked if Sara was in there. An arm suddenly reached out from inside Danny's trench coat and handed Matt a bar of chocolate. Matt thanked Sara for the chocolate and put the bar of chocolate in his pocket. Matt shaked out Danny's coat one more time. Matt then spun around holding the trenchcoat and Sara appeared from the trenchcoat. 

The crowd was loving it. Sara introduced herself as Matt gave Danny his trenchcoat back. Danny sighed in relief as he put his coat back on. Garak then decided to freak out an eight year old boy and changed into his own trenchcoat. Danny looked at Garak and was like what are you doing. Garak gave Danny a creepy look and Danny edged over to a Gith girl that was about his age. Garak can hear Danny saying that Garak's creepy to the girl. 

Sara then thanked Matt for the trick and Matt said you're welcome, snapped his fingers, and seemingly disappeared in front of the crowd. Sara then took out a crystal orb and explained that the fortune tellers who uses the crystal balls to predict the future uses fake crystal balls. 

Sara then asked for a volunteer from the audience.  She chose Vogga, the daughter of the owner of the general store Buy the Way, and a six year old Gith boy named Rinoth. Vogga of course tried to flirt with all the men in the crowd while Rinoth is super excited to be a volunteer. 

Sara asked Vogga and Rinoth to take off their coats and lay them down on the muddy ground. Sara then told them to stand on their muddy coats and they did. She then told Rinoth to hold onto Vogga who was like "ew kid germs" and Sara handed Vogga the heavy crystal orb that is absolutely a real crystal orb. Sara then took off her coat and shook it out. She then put her coat up so that only Vogga and Rinoth's heads where showing. Sara asked if they were ready and Vogga and Rinoth nodded their heads. Sara then shook her coat and twirled around. 

Vogga and Rinoth suddenly appeared on the other side of her wearing their dry coats with Vogga still holding onto the crystal orb. Sara told the crowd to give the volunteers a hand. Rick then started to heckle the volunteers asking how did they do that and if they walked or were volunteer actors. Sara said that it's magic. Rick stopped hackling Vogga and Rinoth. Sara then took back the crystal orb and Vogga and Rinoth went back to the crowd. Sara then began to toss the crystal orb into the air and explained that for the last trick she needed her brother. 

Sara asked the audience if they see Matt around. As they were looking, Sara accidentally dropped the crystal orb and the orb shattered. The second the crystal orb shattered, Matt appeared standing onto of the shattered remains of the crystal orb. 

The crowd was loving the street magic show. Matt then clapped and rubbed his hands together. He said that for the last trick he needs the crowd to take a couple of steps back. They did and Matt pulled his hands apart and produced a metal rod. Sara then produce a long copper wire from her hand. Matt stood the rod up and Trishana used her root steps to gracefully stand on the top of the rod. Sara then began to wrap the copper wire around the rod. 

Sara then took a flint and steel out of her pocket and asked everyone if they were ready for the finale trick. The crowd was excited. Sara struck the flint and steel against the metal rod. The hair of Trishana, Sara, and Matt stood up on the ends. The front part of the crowd hair started to stand as well. 

Sara stroke the flint and steel a second time and those in the middle of the crowd began to feel the results of static electricity. When Sara struck the third time, there was a flash of lighting and Trishana and Matt disappeared in a flash of lighting. Sara then clapped and thank the crowd for watching. Rick then asked where Trishana and Matt went. 

Sara was then like oh yeah. She struck the flint and steel one more time and Matt and Trishana appeared in a flash of lighting. Everyone was super impressed by the trick. Jean then took his hat and began to collect money from the crowd. Jean then walked up to Matt. Jean began to tell Matt on what he needs to improve and told him good job. 

Meanwhile, Trishana said that she's going to head over to the Nightclaw Inn for a mocha. Sara walked up to Mellerel and stated that she saw that you took the baby to the church. Mellerel told Sara that yes and that they're going to find a home for baby Kipp. Sara said that's good and that Mellerel made the right choice. Sara then looked a bit sad and without saying anything else to Mellerel turned and headed into the town. 

Eeddi asked the party if anyone would be interested in going to Xybi's Tree Pub later. They said maybe but had to do some stuff. Jean and Mellerel decided to go to the Murchada Lumber Store and get drumsticks for the Aarakocra. Garak decided to return to the lumber camp to spread rumors about how the mushrooms are a punishment for angering Grelasis and the Murchada family is trying to cover it up and get the loggers killed horribly "for profit".

## Eeddi's curiosity ##

As Matt began to take apart the copper wire metal rod, Eeddi walks up to him and began to ask him how to make the copper wire. He said that since copper has a low melting temperature that they just take copper coins and melt them down and use this rod as a make shift mold. Matt showed Eeddi that the rod was somewhat hollow on the inside. Matt then headed off towards Xybi's Tree Pub. 

Eeddi then decided to head over to Bob's Blacksmith to see about getting some copper wire. When she arrived Bob was working on a cooking pot stand. He asked what he can do. She began to try to make small talk about the carnival tonight. Bob said that he doesn't go to carnivals or parties or anything of the sort. She invited him to Xybi's Tree Pub for a drink and he flat out said no. 

Eeddi then asked what he was doing tonight instead and he told her sleeping. She continued to press him for details and asked him what he did for fun. Bob told her blacksmithing and reading. Eeddi then asked what kind of books and he said anything. 

Eeddi then asked Bob how to make a copper wire. He told her melt down copper and pour it into a mold. Eeddi asked Bob if he can show her how to do it. Bob said no and Eeddi then asked if she can order some. Bob told her sure and Eeddi requested for a meter of copper wire. Eeddi then asked Bob if it would be okay to bring him a gnome book. Bob said in three days when he has the copper wire finished. Eeddi managed to persuade Bob to bring him the book tomorrow and he said fine. 

As Eeddi was turning to leave, Bob asked Eeddi how long was she going to keep that pink coral on her. Eeddi was shocked and asked what pink coral. Bob said the one from the Mayor's mini museum that's wrapped up in a napkin in her pocket. Bob points to the little coral bulge at her pocket. 

Eeddi was in awe of how Bob knew and asked him so. Bob said that he can see patterns and have a very good spatial mind. He's been to the museum enough times to see the coral and know what it looks like regardless of whether it's right side up or not. Eeddi was in awe and asked him if it was like magic. Bob said no. Eeddi then asked Bob if he was going to tell anyone. Bob said no and that her madness will tell on her. 

As Eeddi began to leave, Bob caught her attention and said that he has a hinge ready for Brightpicker. He handed the hinge to Eeddi and told her that it was already paid for. Eeddi thank Bob and she headed back to Brightpicker's Repair Shop.
