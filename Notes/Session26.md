# Session 26

## Business Man

Jean and Mellerel watched as the shadowy figure emerged from the spice and sauce corner of Meat Me in Saint Louie's. The shadow moved towards the kitchen area and a few minutes later Jean and Mellerel saw a small light come on in one of the rooms above the barbaque place. 

A couple minutes later they see the light turned off and from behind the barbaque place comes a very frightened Xi-Tao being escorted by the shadow. After a few minutes, the shadow transformed into a businessman that was escorting Xi-Tao towards the back of the Nightclaw Inn. 

Mellerel was hesitant about following the scary shadow businessman, but Jean was like a child is in legitimate danger and we're going to follow them. Mellerel and Jean then began to stealthily follow Xi-Tao and businessman towards the inn using a very convincing stage prop tree. 

## Who goes there?

Meanwhile, Garak and Eeddi are still working on their lock picking skills when they heard someone flying over and into the outer edge of the forest. Garak and Eeddi saw Gage landing in front of Xi-Tao who was being escorted by a businessman dressed in a suit, tie, cane, and fedora. 

Xi-Tao asked if Meng, his small pet dog, was okay. Gage said that Meng will be okay if Xi-Tao follows instructions. Eeddi tried to get closer, but businessman heard her moving. Luckily, Eeddi had barely passed the sneakies as businessman used his cane to cast magic missile. 

Gage ordered businessman to quiet it down. Businessman turned to look at Gage in annoyance and Gage was somewhat nervous, but he turned to back to Xi-Tao and began to threaten him. Gage told Xi-Tao that the king's memorial service is tomorrow and that Xi-Tao better finish up in town or Gage will get rid of Meng. 

Garak then attempted to get closer to Garak, Xi-Tao, and businessman. But just like Eeddi, Garak was heard. The businessman quickly turned towards Garak and cast firebolt in Garak's direction. The firebolt set the bush that Garak was hiding in. He rolled over to another bush and successfully managed to hide from businessman. 

Gage turned to businessman and angrily told him that he was going to get us caught and put the fire out now! The businessman waved his cane and then walked up to Gage intimidating him. Gage became somewhat fearful of the businessman and told the group that they need to get going. 

## Mushroom Base

As Gage, Xi-Tao, and businessman entered the forest, Jean and Mellerel exposed themselves from their tree disguise and motioned for Garak and Eeddi to come with them. The party managed to successfully follow Gage, Xi-Tao, and businessman through the woods.

After an hour or so, the party followed them to what seems like a giant mushroom base. Gage shouted to let them in and a few minutes later, the mushroom wall opened up and put comes two Istrarian Dynasty regular army guards (aka: The Gray Suns army). 

Gage, Xi-Tao, and businessman walked into the mushroom base being escorted by the guards. As the mushroom wall began to close, Garak quickly took his dagger out and ran as fast and as quietly as he could towards the door. He managed to get his knife between the mushroom door and slowed down the door from closing, but it continue to close. Garak got super lucky and managed to flip himself over and pull his dagger from the mushroom wall that was going to digest it. 

The mushroom wall closed and Garak was on one side of the outdoor mushroom base while the rest of the party was on the other side. Garak hide and saw Gage, Xi-Tao, businessman, and the guards turn right at the end of the mushroom base corridor. 

Since the mushroom wall is 8x10 feet, Jean and Mellerel managed to climb over. Eeddi needed help and the group tied a crowbar to the end of the rope and threw it over a tree branch and managed to pull Eeddi up over the wall country swing style. 

Once the party was in the outdoor mushroom base, they were able to hear a conversation between Gage, Xi-Tao, and a dwarf logger that Garak told the group went by the name Brent. 

## Mech Chet and forced servitude

The group easily scaled the mushroom wall and was able to be in the corridor next to where the conversation was taking place. Eeddi sent up her homunculus and saw that there was a camp of about 20 Gray Suns soldiers as well as Gage, Xi-Tao, businessman, Brent (dressed in Istrarian Dynasty officer wear), and the small dog Meng. 

Brent and Gage was telling Xi-Tao that he better get the Mech Chet working by tomorrow morning or they will kill his dog. Xi-Tao said that he will and asked them to let Meng go when he's finished fixing the Mech Chet. Brent said that of course he's going to let the dog go. However, once the Mech Chet is set up for tomorrow, Xi-Tao WILL accompany the Gray Suns recon group back to the Istrarian Dynasty. Xi-Tao told them that as long as they let Meng go, he'll do whatever they want. 

## The plan

The party plans for Jean to use his jump skills to jump over the wall, announce the beginning of his plan aloud, hold out a blanket in front of him, tie rope to Xi-Tao, Meng, and himself, have the rest of the party to pull them back over the small mushroom wall, and then run for their lives!
