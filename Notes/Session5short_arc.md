# Session 5 (Short Arc) #

As the party head downstairs, two of the party members, Elraina and Eeddi, disappeared leaving Garak, Jean, and Mellerel in the All Faiths Church in Woodsford, Rylia. As the three of you walk down the stairs, you began to hear an infant crying. The three of you decided it was a trap and had began to precede cautiously down the hallway to investigate this crying. You bypass the first door in the hallway as the crying seemed to be coming up ahead. 

## Baby Encounter ##

Garak looks under the crack of the second door in the hallway and was able to see the bottom of bed posts but nothing else. As the party investigates the room they realized that the crying was coming from the room next door. Garak, Jean, and Mellerel went next door and went inside the room to investigate. After searching about, they found a half-elf baby boy at the bottom of the wardrobe. Unsure of what to do with a baby, the first step our party members take is changing the lad's diaper. They then find some baby materials, such as extra clothes, cloth diapers, and a baby bjorn. After some discussion, the group decided to have Mellerel wear the baby bjorn. The group managed to appease the baby by giving him water and letting him suck on his ivory parrot binky. 

## Library ##

The group then headed to the closest door to the stairs and saw that was a burnt out library. Many of the books and furniture and shelves of the library were blacken and charred. In the middle of the library was a pile of ash that still had embers. It was determined that this fire had burned itself out about eight hours ago. About this time, Eeddi reappeared and asked what was going on and what was that thing aka baby. The group brief her on how they found a baby and was now on the quest to find some food for Mr. Baby Man. Garak came up with the brilliant idea to barbaque the liver that he took out of the Pale Man. 

Both Mellerel and Jean informed Garak that was a very bad idea while Eeddi grieved for the destroyed library. After some arguing, Garak made a medicine check and found out that the Pale Man's liver was a "normal" and "healthy" liver of an middle age alcoholic male. Garak and Jean decided to go to investigate the other rooms in the basement of the Church, while Eeddi and Mellerel stayed in the library attempting to appease their new overlord by having the baby pull their hair and suck on anything that came within an inch of his mouth.

While Mellerel and Eeddi waited in the library for Garak and Jean to return, they found a spell scroll that can cast Erupting Earth thanks to Eeddi's ritual casting of detect magic. They also found that the baby was wearing a magical necklace glowing light blue. The necklace was a small prayer necklace of Enubus, Goddess of Peace, with a single word written on the back of the necklace in Celestial. 

## Dining Room ##

Garak and Jean began to search the rest of the hallway and eventually found the dining room which rinks. Garak and Jean open the door to find 9 dead corpses scattered about the dining room as well as rotting food. Ahead of them they saw another door where the sounds of moaning and grunting and clattering behind it. Getting the sense that is where the kitchen is, Jean and Garak went back to Mellerel and Eeddi to the party decided to attack the creatures behind the door so they can get their newly adopted son food. 

The party went to the dining room and as they got closer to the dining room Mr. Baby Man began to get more and more distressed. The party came up with a plan and got into position, with Jean opening the door to let the creatures out, Garak sneak attacking the first creature, and Mellerel and Eeddi using their range attack to fire upon the creature. Jean opened the door and Garak successfully managed to sneak attack the first zombie who went prone. Mellerel and Eeddi then used their ranged attacks to attack the second zombie that was attempting to step over its friend.
