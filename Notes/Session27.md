# Session 27

## Scouting Squirrel 

Eeddi sends up flying squirrel homunculus and scouts out the camp. In a small cage, you saw that Xi-Tao had attached a mechanical leg to his puppers, Meng, and was being guarded by Businessman and 2 additional guards. Gage and the Gray Suns commander, a dwarf logger named Brent, were threatening Xi-Tao that he better be able to get the Mech Chet working by tomorrow because that's when the king's memorial service is going to be. 

Brent and Gage then walked into the command tent, while Xi-Tao finished taking care of Meng. Once Meng was comforted, the guards locked Meng's cage and escorted Xi-Tao to an outdoor workshop where under the watchful eyes of businessman and the 2 guards began to work. 

Squirrel also reported that there were 2 additional guards guarding a small circular tent in the middle as well as a guard guarding a shed on the other side of the camp. There were also 5 leather camping tents that in total can fit up to 20 people. There was also a correl near the command tent that had 3 adorable looking horsies. 

## The plan

It was decided by the party that Jean was going to jump the mushroom wall with some ropes to get Xi-Tao and Meng. Meanwhile, Garak and Eeddi as well as Mellerel went to the other side of the camp to cause a distraction. 

When everyone got into position, the action commence. Jean jumped over the wall and announce his presence. Suddenly, using a mixture of dancing lights and spooky screams, Mellerel transformed into her dread form and began to frighten everyone around. Some of the guards were like "shoot it!" But missed. Mellerel then shouted in spooky spooks voice that you did this and caused the command tent to catch on fire via create bonfire. 

Jean meanwhile shouted at Xi-Tao who was hiding under the table to run and that we're getting out of here. Throughout the entire time, the businessman had been drawing a circle and various symbols on the ground around him and Xi-Tao. Garak and Eeddi had been putting all their focus on the businessman to stop him from doing whatever he was doing by shooting him with arrows and firebolt. 

After a few seconds of hesitation, Xi-Tao began to crawl out from under the table he was hiding towards Jean who was trying to get Meng out of the cage.
