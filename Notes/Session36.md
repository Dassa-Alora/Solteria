# Session 36

## Giant Snow Capybara Herd

You guys approach the growling to find two dogs herding a group of snow capybaras. The Stagmans snow capybara tracks lead through the herd. As you investigate, you realized that this herd is huge. You attempt to sneak through the herd, but the dogs heard you and immediately teleported to confront you. 

You all noticed that the dogs would growl and become some what aggressive when you get too close to the capybaras. But the dogs would let you past through the herd as long as you don't get too close to the capybaras. 

The party managed to walk through the giant capybara herd, all the while seeing white humanoid figures at the edge of your periphery. After an hour or so, you reach the edge of the boundary and the dogs went back to guarding the herd. 

At the boundary of the herd, you find a large boulder with a brand ST carved into it. Garak recognized the brand since he grew up herding capybaras. The giant herd belonged to the capybara Baron family known as the Sediments. They're a Earth Gensai family and own one of the largest ranches in all of Myrland.

## Zeanke, goddess of the hunt ritual

After the herd you continued to follow the Stagmans snow capybara tracks. It began to snow and the tracks began to disappear. They seemed to have led to a small area of trees. As you get closer, you can hear a capybara braying in distress. 

As you get closer, you realize that there are 4 lizardfolk surrounding a tied up capybara. You try to sneak to get a closer look, but the lizardfolk spot some of you. Eeddi and Garak pretended to be interested in helping the lizardfolk with their ritual to raise Zeanke the goddess of the hunt. 

The lizardfolk gave Eeddi and Garak torches to set the snow capybara on fire for the ritual. While they played along with the lizardfolks ritual, Garak noticed that the capybara that they were going to sacrifice was branded as Lord Mayor Katrin's capybara. 

Just when they were about to set the capybara on fire, Garak attacked the leading lizardfolk. Mellerel cast silent image of Zeanke and Eeddi used magical tinkering to voice Zeanke. Since the lizardfolk leader got stabbed just as Eeddi and Mellerel initiate their plan, the lizardfolk attack the party. You managed to successfully defeat the lizardfolk and save the capybara that was clearly taken from the Stagmans.
