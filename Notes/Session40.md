# Session 40

## Eeddi's Watch

Eeddi began to ask why his eyes glow red. Lock would ask if she knows much about Warforges. Eeddi said no but she'll investigate to see if he needs his repairs. Eeddi finds Lock's soul which is a marble of crystal with emerald like liquid sand moving about inside the crystal. 

Eeddi asks if she can do brain surgry and Lock is like no. During the Eeddi's watch, both Eeddi and Lock heard the same growling off in the distance. The creatures were close enough to be heard but not close enough to be seen. 

When morning came, the party tried to see if they were able to find any tracks of the creatures that were making the growling noise but it had snow enough to not be able to any tracks from the creatures. The party then headed out following the river. 

## The Sunken One

As the day wore on, peaks of sun began to pop out of the clouds. The party suddenly noticed a glint near the river and noticed a thick post on the bank of the river. Upon closer inspection, you guys noticed that there is a large chain attached to a crank that has been nailed into the post. 

After loosing ice and cranking the long cage out of the river, the party meets a Sunken One (Sahuagin). The Sunken One asked the party for help on letting him out. Jean was all like there's a reason why you're in a cage to which the Sunken One was didn't realize it was a cage when he swam in. 

However, the more you question the Sunken One, the more suspicious the party became. Eventually, the Sunken One said that an elf wearing furs locked him in the cage because he ate something that apparently made the elf angry. The Sunken One didn't elaborate, but promised to give the party a water proof candle if they let him out. 

After a bit, the party let the Sunken One out of the cage. Before anyone or anything can stop the Sunken One, he threw the Candle of the Deep towards the party and disappeared in the river. 

As you all were talking trying to figure out if the Sunken One was in jail or being used as bait, Jean noticed that there was a chalk symbol on the wrench that had broke when the party began to wrench the chain up. 

No one really needed to roll to figure out that was indeed an alarm spell that you all broke. The party then decided to head out towards Cormaig as fast as they could in hopes of avoiding whoever had locked the Sunken One in the cage.
