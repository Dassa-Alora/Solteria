# Session 37

## Capyapox

You all defeated the lizardfolk and began to search the campsite. The Capybara looks terrible. It has bloody and matted fur and pustules all over the poor capyabara. You guys rolled it off of the unlit firewood and tried to make it comfortable by starting the fire next to it. 

You all then searched the campsite. Garak took some rotting lizardfolk flesh that was found in one of the lizardfolk backpacks. Eeddi found a potion of healing. Afterwards, the party discussed what to do about the sick capybara. Eeddi decided to touch the capybara with the now green coral. The sick capybara immediately died. Garak sighed and pushed the dead capybara into the fire. 

As the party talked, Jean remember reading a small article about how the Yakarak Pox jumped the border of the Hiano and into Myrland. It also began to jump from the Yakaraks to the snow capybaras. The article stated that there has yet to be any people cases of the Yakarak Pox. 

## Stagmans Camp

You guys continued to follow the tracks of the now single capybara. As dark begins to fall, you all see a small snow mound to find a dead snow capybara covered in pox. Through the descending darkness, you all see a small campfire up ahead. 

You all approach the fire to find Uncle Owen and Yu-Tao, Xi-Tao's older sister. Uncle Owen clearly had the pox but was still functioning as he was just getting pustules. You were unable to figure out if Yu-Tao had the pox as she was covered from head to toe in multiple layers of clothing with only her eyes showing. 

The party asked Uncle Owen how they got the pox and he told the group that they weren't sure. His best guess was from carnival, but he wasn't entirely sure as he didn't recall seeing any sick animals. Owen then tells you that Xi-Tao and Wan-Tao started to not feel well the day they left and continued to worsen the further they got from Elagdias. 

They eventually had to abandon one of their two snow capybaras as it was too sick to continue on. Once it was clear that the brothers had the pox, Louis and his wife Tao began to get sick. Eventually, they had to stop as Xi-Tao and Wan-Tao were too sick to move. Pretty soon, everyone got the pox except Yu-Tao. Meng also has the pox, but not as severe as the people. 

After talking to Uncle Owen, it was decided that Jean was going to use his healings to heal Xi-Tao, Wan-Tao, Tao, and Louis and get them stable enough to move the family back towards the Sediment family ranch using sleds that are going to be constructed overnight.
