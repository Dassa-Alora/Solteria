## Rock Hunting with Danny ##

Elraina finishes having breakfast with Lord Mayor Katrin and her young son Danny. After breakfast, Danny asks Elraina if she wanted to go rock hunting with him. Elraina said sure and the two went out to the courtyard of the Lord Mayor's mansion to examine rocks. After a bit, Danny told Elraina that he wanted to go to look at river rocks. He then asked her if she had a gold coin. Elraina thought this was a rather odd requested and asked Danny why he needed a gold coin to look at river rocks.

Danny then explains to Elraina that the Murchadha family owns all of the property in town along the banks of the Eorrian River. Danny then goes onto explain that the guard allows him to explore the river banks and go rock hunting on Murchadha Lumber Mill land as long as Danny gives him a gold coin. Elraina thought this was suspicious, but agreed to follow Danny.

Once Elraina and Danny got to the outskirts of the town, Danny leads her up to the last gate that led onto the land own by the Lumber Mill. Danny then bent down and picked up a smooth green stone and said "Baron, I want to go rock hunting" very fast and quickly dropped the stone. 

A few minutes later, a teenage Elven boy name Baron who was wearing a trench coat walks up to the gate. He greets Danny and Elraina and asks for a gold coin so he can let Danny inside. Danny told him that he doesn't have a gold coin. Elraina then pulled out her diplomatic identification card and showed Baron. Baron shrugged and opened the gate to let Danny and Elraina inside. After the two got inside the gate, Baron told Danny that since he didn't pay him a gold coin then Danny would need to deliver some goods to his supplier and then come back with the contraband.

Danny then asked if the contraband he had to bring back to Baron was pipe weed to which Baron responded "Don't be ridiculous. I'm not going to have a child move pipe weed." Baron then opened his trench coat to show Danny and Elraina chocolate bars. Danny asked if he could have a chocolate bar and he was all like "Sure kid". Baron gave Danny a chocolate bar and told Danny that his supplier wants chocolate bars. Danny said okay and Baron told him to go rock hunting.

Meanwhile, Elraina was frozen in horror as she realized that Danny and Baron were running a contraband ring for the loggers of the Murchadha Lumber Mill. Without a word, Elraina handed Baron a gold coin to which he responded "But Danny said he was going to move the chocolate bars". Elraina then said no he isn't and insisted that Baron takes the gold coin. After a minute, Baron sighs, pockets Elraina's gold coin, and hid his trench coat full of chocolate bars in the bushes.     

## The Murchadha Lumber Mill ##

Aron Murchadha led Eeddi to the Murchadha Lumber Mill. All the while degrading and complaining about how no one but him knows how to do anything around her. Eeddi argued with Aron that he was the one that messed things up and not her and Brightpicker. As Eeddi and Aron walked towards the backside of the lumber mill, a Lizardfolk that went by the name Steve made eye contact with Eeddi. The two were puzzled and trying to figure out if they knew each other. But before Eeddi and Steve got a chance to interact, Aron led Eeddi into a small door that led inside of the Lumber Mill.

Inside the lumber mill was old logger, young logger, and kid logger all standing around the small saw that was broken. Eeddi then examined the saw and realized that the loggers weren't loading the wood into the saw straight. She told them that they needed to load the wood straight into the saw and not crooked. After some discussion, she realized that the three loggers had not been there for more than three weeks and that they had received no training. Eeddi then said that she's going to report Aron to the saftey committee to which Aron replied that they don't need safety committees and demanded Eeddi to fix it. 

Aron left and Eeddi began to teach the loggers as well as fix the saw that was broken down. After Aron left, Steve walked up to where Eeddi was helping the loggers. Eeddi saw Steve and asked if Steve wanted to learn how to repair and use the saw. Steve was like sure!  

## Buy the Way ##

Jean and Mellerel began to walk towards Elagdias. As they were walking, Sara ran up to them carrying Kipp in the baby bjourn. She told Jean and Mellerel that Matt and Trishana were really wanting to incorporate Kipp into their act and were going to start practicing for tonight. So Sara wanted to know if they wanted her to come along with Kipp or if they just wanted to take Kipp and she can go back to try and calm Matt and Trishana from the baby magic act idea. Jean and Mellerel told Sara that she should go back to camp and they can take Kipp into town to get him sized for baby clothes and possible find a family who wants a baby. Sara said sure and quickly and easily transferred the baby bjourn onto Mellerel. Sara then went back to camp while Jean and Mellerel continued onto Elagdias.

As they came into town, one side of the town was a huge Lumber mill. The other side of the town were various shops and businesses. As they walked through the town, the guards of the Murchadha Lumber Mill kept an eye on them. The first shop that they stopped at was a general store called Buy the Way. Jean, Mellerel, and Kipp walked into the brightly lit store. All around them were various goods that people need for their daily lives. 

Upon entering, they met a beautiful teenage orc girl. She began to flirty with Jean. As Jean showed the girl a magic trick, a loud, deep and intimidating voice echoed from the front of the store. "Vogga! Go start doing fruit inventory in the back!" The owner of Buy the Way and father of the teenage orc girl said.

The Orc dad walked up to Jean and Mellerel and asked them if he can help them with anything. He then saw that Mellerel was carrying a baby and told her that baby's going to need some warmer clothes if you want him to survive the winter. The Orc dad suggested stopping by Fit Sew Good to get swaddle clothes. Jean and Mellerel then asked for information about the people that were in their dream. Orc dad told them that if they wanted information then they should check out Xybi's Tree Pub claiming that Satyr has ears everywhere. Orc dad then recalled that they had recently hired a weird Lizardfolk down at the Murchadha Lumber Mill. He told them that he was a rather odd fellow.

Jean and Mellerel thanked him for the information. Vogga then walked out of the back with two cases of strawberries that were about to go bad. She said that these were the only fruit that she was able to find. Orc dad then asked if Jean and Mellerel wanted to buy some strawberries. Jean said sure and him and Mellerel paid 2 gold for the strawberries. Vogga began to try to flirt with Jean again, but Orc Dad stepped between her and Jean. Jean then did a magic trick to hand Orc dad the gold and considered leaving him his "phone number" but decided against it because of Orc Dad was too old for Jean's liking. 

Jean and Mellerel then left Buy the Way. As they were walking towards the lumber mill, they spotted Eeddi and Garak (aka Steve) working in the lumber mill and Elraina spotted Jean and Mellerel as she kept an eye on Danny rock hunting.

### Thus the Party almost came together! ###
