# Session 32

## Rubble or not 

After a massive explosion that severely damaged the Lord Mayor's Manor, Mellerel and Xi-Tao were trapped in one rubble bubble while Eeddi and Elise were trapped in another rubble bubble. Once everyone got oriented, Lord Mayor Katrin screamed her son's name and ran out of the ruined manor to find Danny. 

Everyone else who managed to avoid being in a rubble bubble stayed to help Mellerel, Eeddi, Xi-Tao and Elise who were trapped under the rubble. After a few minutes, you all managed to free Mellerel, Eeddi, Xi-Tao, and Elise. Jean and Eeddi healed Xi-Tao and Elise. After that, Wan-Tao and Baron helped Elise and Xi-Tao to safety and the party then went outside to see what happened. 

## Undead Happens 

Once you all got outside, you saw that the Murchadha Lumber Mill was practically destroyed by what looks like a black hole that was actually a portal where three Gray Suns Soldiers were guarding a girl that was about Elise's age. The girl was messing with a black box that had numerous metal pegs sticking out from it. 

Coming towards you all were 8 zombies that had clearly been loggers at some point. You began to fight the zombies all the while slowly making your way towards the black portal where the Gray Suns Soldiers and the scientist ðŸ¤· was?

When you all got closer, it was clear that the scientist was terrified of the predicament that she had found herself in. Jean tried to taunt her with vicious mockery, but it failed and her response seemed to be an automatic response of "I'm trying." 

After fighting some more, you all got too close for the comfort of the Gray Suns who was guarding the scientist. The soldiers grabbed the girl and pulled her back through the portal. The second that the strange box crossed back through the portal, all of the zombies that were attacking the town dropped simultaneously and became truly dead.
