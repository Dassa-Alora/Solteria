# Session 31

## Shopping

During the night, Mellerel summoned her familiar, wolf spider named Abomination, and Eeddi built her steel defender, a cute mechanical cat named Atzie. After everyone woke up, the group decided to go shopping. You asked Lord Mayor Katrin about getting some stuff and she said that the Head of the Murchadha Lumber Guards would be happy to give you ONE THING! 

The Guard escorted you to the main guard post at the Murchadha Lumber Mill and let the party pick ONE THING each. As you all were walking, you noticed that all of Elagdias was practically on lock down. Garak choose a rapier and Jean got some studded leather. Eeddi choose to take a whip. Mellerel didn't choose anything though her spider familiar followed her. 

Abo said hi and Mellerel was kind of freaking out that a wolf spider was talking to her. She asked what is this all about and Abo was I'm a part of you and you summon me which made Mellerel freak out more. Suddenly, a guard taking out a large garbage bag passed and a part of a sandwich fell out from the hole near the bottom. Abo scurries over to the sandwich and starts to eat it. Atzie got curious about a spider eating a sandwich and went to investigate. Abo turned towards Atzie and told her that it was his sandwich.

## Shop Talk

After the group got their new stuff, they went over to the Murchadha Lumber Store and began to talk to Orliee. Garak of course tried to converse in Theive's Cant and Orliee was not having any of it, because she could tell the others weren't park of the crime world. 

You all tell her that it is safe for Baron and Elise to come back into town. Orliee told the group that she knows and that Baron and Elise are going to have dinner with Lord Mayor Katrin. However, due to recent events, Baron and Elise had asked Orliee to come get them when it gets closer to dinner time to avoid townsfolk who would be asking questions. Orliee thanks the party for everything that you did to help her little brother and the party left. 

The party then headed to Brightpicker's Repair Shop. When they arrived, they noticed that the door was locked, the lights were off, and the closed sign was up. The group cautiously entered the shop and began to investigate what happened to Brightpicker. 

Eeddi found a note in his apartment saying that he had to leave on business and that his sister Steeldreams will be taking over the store in a week. She found that Brightpicker left Eeddi a 100 gp Royal bond. Eeddi pocketed the note and the bond and found a glass jar. She put the crazy coral into the glass jar and sealed it.

After the group figured out what happened to Brightpicker, they headed over to Bob's Blacksmith so that Eeddi can pick up her copper wire. Bob was working on a stove door when the group arrived and Eeddi asked Bob why he was working when he could have a day off. Bob said that he liked his job and doesn't mind the work at all. 

Eeddi asked Bob about infusing the crazy coral into a dagger and Bob was all like not this stuff again. He told her that she should put it back, but if she was dead set on keeping it, he knew someone who can help her. Bob tells Eeddi that he knows a Firblog artificer name Davyre Vuldre, who was working in Iaonahall, Ocimeul last he heard. Bob tells Eeddi that Davyre is a professional when it comes to infusing dangerous materials together.

After the conversation, Bob gave Eeddi her copper wire that she had ordered. Eeddi noticed that he gave her more wire than she had asked for and had tried to pay Bob for the correct amount of gold for the wire. Bob refused payment, but Eeddi insisted. So Bob asked for the next book in The Adventures of Palug the Goblin book series. 

Eeddi was like of course and went back to her apartment at Brightpicker's Repair Shop and brought the entire collection of the book series. Bob was unsure of taking the entire collection as he didn't want to lose any of the books, but Eeddi insisted. Bob accepted and thanked her for letting him borrow the book series. After that, it was getting around dinner time so the group headed to Lord Mayor Katrin's Manor.

## Mayor's house

As the party walked into the Manor, you all noticed that Walter, the undead octopus was still "pacing" around in his tank nervously. You all then went to the dining room where, Elise, Baron, Xi-Tao, Wan-Tao, Katrin, and Druug were already sitting at the large dinner table. While having dinner with the group, Lord Mayor Katrin told the party that they have been a great help these past few days and wanted to ask the party one more thing before you all go on your way. Lord Katrin then laid out 3 missions that the party can choose.

## Missions

1. Escort the Stagmans to the AAA port city of Cod Row located on the southwest coast of Myrland. The Stagmans have closed their barbaque place Meat Me at Saint Louis permanently. There will be 2 large carts full of the Stagmans possessions being pulled by giant snow capybaras. Once at Cod Row, the Stagmans will board a ship of the Queen's Navy and will sail along the coast of the Shrouded Deep to the desert country known as Ocumiel. Those who will be heading to Cod Row are:

       Louis Stagman (dad)
       Tao Stagman (mom)
       Wan-Tao Stagman (oldest son)
       Yu-Tao Stagman (oldest daughter)
       Xi-Tao Stagman (youngest child)
       Meng (family dog)
       Uncle Owen Stagman (Louis younger brother)
       Five Murchadha Lumber Guards

Beginning Compensation: Lord Mayor Katrin will give each party member 50 gold as well as Black Cards for the Buy the Way, Elagdias General Store. 

Ending Compensation: Surprise compensation from the Queen or one of her representatives. 

Approximate time: 2 weeks 

2. Escort Elise and Baron to the college town of Cormaig, home of the Myrland Arcane Institute. Elise and Baron are hoping to move to Cormaig together. Elise wants to attend the school for Art while Baron wants to work supporting the two of them. This will be a light "caravan" so no carts or animals to care for. Those who will be heading to Cormaig are:

       Baron Murchadha
       Elise
       Orilee
       Sly Crow
       Jock Murchadha Guard 

Beginning Compensation: Lord Mayor Katrin will give each party member 50 gold as well as Black Cards for the Buy the Way, Elagdias General Store.

Ending Compensation: Surprised Compensation from Orilee and a surprise favor from the Crows of the Midnight Suns. 

Approximate time: 1 week 

3. Search for and escort a wizard named Fritz. Fritz is the "local" wizard that would occasionally travel around the local communities and offer his services for a price. Recently, Lord Mayor Katrin had sent a few ravens to Fritz asking for help with the cannibal mushrooms. Now that the cannibal mushrooms grew exponentially, it is seen by the Lord Mayor Katrin as a dangerous threat that must be dealt with as soon as possible. After all, it's only a matter of time before some drunk loggers decide to set it on fire. You will be the only ones going. 

Beginning Compensation: Lord Mayor Katrin will give each party member 100 gold.

Ending Compensation: Something magical I can assure you.

Approximate time: 1 week 

## Explosions!

While Katrin was explaining to the group about what was going to happen next, a large explosion ripped through the Manor. Everyone but Eeddi, Mellerel, Elise, and Xi-Tao made their saves. Unfortunately, Eeddi is buried in an alcove of rubble with the unconscious Elise and Mellerel is buried under rubble that is barely being supported by the large thick dinner table with the unconscious Xi-Tao.
