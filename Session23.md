# Session 23

## What's the point?

As the party and Orilee headed back to Elagdias, you all discuss the purpose of the pranksters, who is suspected to be Gage and Xi-Tao, doing pranks with the Mech Chet which can supposedly can do anything. The group came to 2 conclusions. 

First, that the pranksters found a Mech Chet and have no idea what they're doing and just pushing buttons. The second is that the pranksters know exactly what they're messing with and that they're testing it out for some reason. 

Once the party got back into town, Orilee thanked the party for working on clearing her brother, Baron's name. She told you all that she'll be around until the start of the carnival if you all need anything else from her. Orilee then left and the party headed to Lord Mayor Katrin's Manor to pick up the Writ of Assistance letter. 

## Lord Mayor Katrin's Manor 

You all arrived back at the manor and went upstairs to get the letter. She asked the party if you all found out anything about Baron's location. The party said that they're going to continue to investigate and avoided giving her any information. 

The party then investigated the room that Baron was staying in while under house arrest. You all didn't find much, but you did find a tiny folder up piece of paper that was by the small waste bin next to the writing desk.

You all opened it up and saw that it was blank. After some discussing, Jean used a lighter to see that there was a list written in invisible ink. It was most likely written by Baron and said:

                          Gage and Xi-Tao
                          Terrorists?
                          Demons?
                          Spies... YES SPIES!

The party continued to investigate and came to the conclusion that Baron and Elise story was correct and that Elise had unlocked the door for Baron to run off when she brought him his lunch. After the party finished investigating the room, you all headed out of the Lord Mayor Katrin's Manor and had dinner at *insert food place name here*. 

## Elagdias Town Fair

After dinner, the party stood in line to get into the carnival. When you all got to the front of the ticket line, you all gave him the Writ of Assistance and the gnome just stared at it not reading it at all. He then looked at the posters of Jean and Mellerel and then down at the letter and up at the party. The miserable gnome said "whatever" and motioned for the party to go on in. 

The carnival was laid out different than yesterday. Jean and Mellerel were very familiar with this having follow King Thomas MacSual's precession for a while. The second day of Countess Bellindana's Big Top is focused mostly on the townsfolk and what the town is all about. Countess Bellindana is very big on encouraging different cultures to show off, for a price. 

The front part of Countess Bellindana's Big Top consisted of what was basically a town fair. There were direction signs pointing to various locations that were being run by the people of Elagdias. The town fair portion of the carnival consisted of:

Cake Decorating Contest
Tinker's Contest
Pop Up Bar
Pie Eating Contest
Animal Contest/Petting Zoo
Barbaque Stand

The part that was Countess Bellindana's Big Top was near the back of the carnival and consisted of:

Carnival Games
Magic Show Tent
Animal Show Tent
Physical Feats Show Tent

## Tinker's Contest

Jean decided to set up his magic show at the boundary between the Elagdias Town Fair and Countess Bellindana's Big Top carnival so he can keep an eye out for anything suspicious on both sides. 

The rest of the party went to look through the Tinker's Contest to see if there was anything that resembled a Mech Chet in the contest. Eeddi immediately saw all the cool tinker's things and skipped off to look at various inventions and asked countless questions to the inventors. 

Mellerel and Garak decided to each take one side of the Tinker's Contest. Mellerel went to look at the Adult age group Tinker's Contest and Garak went to look at the Children age group of the Tinker's Contest. 

Mellerel was pretty impressed by the various inventions that the adults have made. Especially, Brightpicker's toy train set that all the kids were playing at. She looked up at Brightpicker and noticed that he no longer looked exhausted and sleep deprived. Instead, Brightpicker looked refreshed and seemed to be enjoying himself. 

She also was super impressed by a dwarf logger name Brent who had displayed a terrarium at the Tinker's Contest. He told Mellerel that he started it when he was a kid and kept working on it since then. Mellerel said that it was very beautiful. Brent thanked her and then Mellerel continued to investigate the Adult Tinker's Contest.

Garak check out the Children's Tinker's Contest and eventually stumbled upon Xi-Tao how was near the end of the aisle where the older kids had their invention set up. Xi-Tao's invention looked a lot like a distillery. 

Garak asked him what his invention does and Xi-Tao answered that "Makes water." Garak asked for a demonstration and Xi-Tao took a cup and put it under the spout at the front of the distillery and then took a bucket of extremely dirty water and pour it into the distillery. Xi-Tao warned Garak that it's going to be loud and turned the distillery on. 

After a few seconds of loud metallic grinding and squeaking, clear water came out of the spout and into the small cup. Xi-Tao told Garak to drink it and Garak did. It was absolutely the best water Garak had ever tasted. Garak told Xi-Tao that he was impressed with the kid's invention and Xi-Tao said thanks. 

Garak then headed away to meet back up with Mellerel. As Garak was walking away, he heard an adult ask what Xi-Tao's invention did. Xi-Tao told them that it makes water and the adult began to laugh at him saying "That's it. I can get water from the river." 

Garak met up with Mellerel and told her all about Xi-Tao and his very impressive invention. They then decided to go find Eeddi and meet back up with Jean. 

## Cake Decorating Contest

Jean had successfully impressed the attendees of the carnival while continuing to keep an eye on things. After a bit, Jean's eyes fell upon the Cake Decorating Contest and managed to see the Owlin known as Gage standing next to a beautiful mountain landscape cake.
