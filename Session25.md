# Session 25

## Eeddi

While Jean, Mellerel, and Garak joined the cake decorating contest, Eeddi was busy investigating every single tinker's invention and taking notes on how each invention works and what techniques they used to build with. 

Some of the entries that stood out to Eeddi was the self contained ecosystem that a dwarf logger by the name of Brent had created. The mini ecosystem was planted about 70 years ago when he was but a young lad and has been caring for it since. Inside the large jar we're various mushrooms, ferns, and grasses that had grown. 

Another invention that caught Eeddi's eyes was Brightpicker's toy train. He had finished it and had created little train cars that attached to the train. Another thing that stood out was that unlike this morning, Brightpicker not only looked refreshed and well rested, but didn't seemed at all stressed and anxious like he was earlier. 

The last invention that caught Eeddi's eyes was Xi-Tao's water purifier. Eeddi was in awe at how advanced a 15 year old kid's tinkering skills were. She did her best to encourage Xi-Tao and complement his ingenuity. 

## Tinker's Contest Winners 

At around 900, the MC of the Tinker's Contest began to announce the winners. For the adults, Brent won third place for his self contained ecosystem. In second place of the Tinker's Contest was Brightpicker and his automotive toy train. The first place prize went to a fairy named Nimbus who created a fabric that was able to stop a short sword from penetrating through the fabric. 

The MC then went onto announce the winners of the age groups of the tinkering children. Mellerel and Garak arrived at the Tinker's Contest just as the MC was announcing the oldest children's age group Tinker's Contest winners. 

Not surprisingly, Xi-Tao got first place for his water purifier. MC asked Xi-Tao how it works. Because of how nervous the kid was, Xi-Tao began to stutter and stammering as he tried to explain. Xi-Tao gave up and showed the audience how his machine works. Unfortunately, Xi-Tao was so nervous that he forgot to put a cup under the water spigot and purified water spilled everywhere. 

Eeddi quickly grabbed a cup and filled it with water that was spilling off the table. Eeddi then shouted in an enthusiastic voice "Behold. Pure Water!" The adult tinkerers were super excited and proud of Xi-Tao's skills. The kid tinkerers and their parents were not impress. Because of this all the kid tinkerers and their parents started to laugh at Xi-Tao. 

Xi-Tao began to sink in his chair in embarrassment. The MC congratulated Xi-Tao and gave him his first prize envelope. Xi-Tao then continued to sink in his chair until he was hiding fully under the table. After the award ceremony, everyone began to disperse and Xi-Tao slowly crawled out from under the table. 

## Gage

Jean, Druug, and Gage headed over to the pop up bar that Xybi's the bartender of Xybi's Tree Pub was running. Like always, he had a chalkboard with the daily riddle for a free drink. After Druug and Jean failed to guess the correct answer, Gage confidently gave Xybi the correct answer and asked for a simple ale. 

Jean, Druug, and Gage then spent about an hour talking about the cake decorating contest and enjoying each other's company. After a bit, an older Owlin walked up to Gage and demanded he comes help his siblings at the Nightclaw Inn. Gage mumbled his disdained for his mother, but followed her instructions and followed his mother out of the town fair and back to the Nightclaw Inn. 

## Xi-Tao

Xi-Tao got out from under the table and began to take his water purifier apart. As he dismantle it, Garak, Mellerel, and Eeddi began to give him praise for his invention. Xi-Tao told the group thanks and when he heard that the Countess Bellindana's Big Top was having a Tinker's Contest a couple of weeks ago, Xi-Tao couldn't help but make something for the contest. 

The party was super impressed that he managed to make a working water purifier in only a few weeks. Garak asked Xi-Tao where he got the materials and Xi-Tao said that he got some of the parts from Brightpicker and Bob, but most of the parts were just parts of other things that he built. Needless to say that the party was super impressed by his talent. 

Xi-Tao then said goodbye and headed towards his family's barbaque stand. The group followed him to the stand and watch as Xi-Tao talk to his mother, Tao, and older sister Yu-Tao. After a few minutes, the three of them then headed back to the meat store/barbaque place called Meat Me in Saint Louie's. 

## Engage the Gage

Jean, Garak, Mellerel, and Eeddi began to discuss if they should follow Xi-Tao to the barbaque place or keep a watch on Gage who was at the Nightclaw Inn. After some discussing, Jean stated that he was more worry about what Gage was up to instead of Xi-Tao. 

The party then decided to head over to the Nightclaw Inn to try and figure out what Gage was up to. When the party arrived at the Nightclaw Inn at around 1030, they found the tavern area packed with Myrland dignitaries for King Thomas MacSual's memorial service in the morning. 

The party walked up to a older looking Owlin and asked for a room. The Owlin, who ended up being Gage's older brother, Arcoth, told the group that unfortunately the inn is closed to the public and has been bought out by various Myrland dignitaries to stay in till the memorial service tomorrow. But Gage's brother said that they can hang out in the tavern until closing. The party went back outside to discuss about what options they had. 

## Gage Stakeout

The party headed out behind the Nightclaw Inn where the inn's courtyard was and began to think up a plan. After some discussion, it was decided that Jean and Mellerel would head over to Meat Me in Saint Louie's and keep up with Xi-Tao while Garak and Eeddi hide in the courtyard bushes and wait for Gage to leave. 

Jean and Mellerel headed to the barbaque place and Eeddi and Garak found a nice little bush to hide in. After a couple of minutes of not seeing or hearing anything, Eeddi asked Garak to teach her more about lock-picking and Garak was all like sure. Eeddi and Garak then began to work on their lock-picking skills instead of keeping an eye out for Gage.

## Xi-Tao Stakeout

Jean and Mellerel arrived at Meat Me in Saint Louie's and was surprised to see that the sign on the door read open. Jean opened the door without hesitation and walked on in with Mellerel following. As they walked in, an older teenage girl that was clearly related to Xi-Tao walked in from the kitchen. She told her that they were close.

Jean and Mellerel pointed out that the door was unlock and the sign was turned to open. Yu-Tao sighed and turned back towards the kitchen telling Xi-Tao that he forgot to lock the door and turned the sign over to close. Xi-Tao said sorry and continued to help his mother in the kitchen. 

Yu-Tao then asked the group how she can help them, and Mellerel said that they were hungry and it smells really good in here. Yu-Tao nodded and asked if they wanted to order something to go. Mellerel was like yes. As Yu-Tao took the orders, Jean began to investigate the front part of the store.

He saw that there was a small dog bed, along with some chew toys and dishes filled with kibble and water. Jean then found that the corner where the sauces and spice racks were seemed very suspicious. It looked very normal, but something big was off and Jean wasn't able to put his finger on it.

While Yu-Tao got Jean and Mellerel's food ready, Mellerel asked about the small dog poster that was taped on the front of the cash register. The poster had a very well drawn picture of a small dog and below that said "Lost Dog. Goes by the name Meng. Reward." 

Yu-Tao told Mellerel that Meng was Xi-Tao's dog and that she had disappeared about six months ago. Xi-Tao was distraught about it and still seems to be even though it's been half a year. She told Mellerel that he still hasn't gotten over Meng and still keeps her dish full of water and kibble in case she comes back. Mellerel told her sorry that her brother's dog is missing. Yu-Tao said that stuff like this happens in life. 

Yu-Tao then gave Mellerel and Jean their orders in to go bags and waited for them to leave. Jean and Mellerel suddenly realized that they were slowly becoming one of "those customers" and quickly grab their food and left Meat Me at Saint Louie's. They second they walked out of the store. Yu-Tao quickly locked the door and dimmed the front lights.

Mellerel and Jean then went across the street to eat their food and to stakeout Xi-Tao's place. At around 145 in the morning, Jean spots a shadowy black shape emerge seamlessly from the corner of the store that Jean felt was off.
