## Lion and Elephant and Gorilla, oh my! ##

Once the animal big top tent exploded into a ton of fireworks, the animals began to panic and fight the animal handlers. The animal handlers managed to take control of the lion by throwing a huge slab of meat in front of the lion and chained it up while it happily munch on it's second dinner. 

The elephant began to trample towards the carnival goers in the game area, but the party managed to turn the elephant's attention towards where the animal big top was via Mellerel's dancing lights. Three carnival hands attempted to lasso the elephant, but two of them got pushed aside and one got gored and his leg got caught in the chain. 

The elephant was now running toward a group of linebacker animal handlers dragging a poor gored animal hand. Garak managed to use his lumberjack ax to cut the chain, freeing the unconscious animal handler. 

Meanwhile, the gorilla was ticked that everything was exploding and decided to run off towards the carnival games to let off some steam, by destroying those said games. The gorilla jumped over the carnival game wall and the party hears a little girl scream. The gorilla began to charge towards the girl's scream when a middle aged Air Genasi burst out of the pile of stuff animals where he and the girl was hiding.

The Air Genasi, Drift, took his sheathed katana out of his belt and pushed it up against the gorilla's chest effectively starting a shoving match. While the gorilla was occupied with Drift, Garak managed to get the girl out of the immediate gorilla's way. The girl called out to Drift, and Drift saw that someone other than him had the girl. Drift yelled angrily at Garak to stop and Garak sat the girl down who hid behind a trashcan. 

Garak then went to help Drift out with the upset gorilla. He offered the gorilla a jar of Varlog. The gorilla at first seemed interested in the Varlog, but ended up throwing it at Drift's face. Eeddi meanwhile found out that she had some cool inter-dimensional bones in her pocket and took one out. She cast magical tinkering and create a fog like effect.

Mellerel then turned her dancing lights into fun little red balls and began to bounce them around the gorilla. The gorilla seemed to have relaxed slightly before Jean made a grand announcement of caging the gorilla. Jean successfully managed to cage the gorilla who got angry again, but calmed down a bit after the red balls began to play with him.

The second that the gorilla was dealt with Drift ran over to Ceana to make sure she was okay. The party then turned their attention over to the charging elephant. Suddenly, the group saw a red flash out of the corner of their eyes. They watched as Countess Bellindana suddenly appeared out of nowhere in front of the charging elephant. She said in a kind and gentle voice, "Stop." And the elephant skid to a stop. The elephant then hugged Countess Bellindana happily.
