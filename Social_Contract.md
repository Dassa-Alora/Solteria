# Social Contract

This social contract is a living document and more information can be added on at anytime.

## Absences
* If you know you will be unable to attend a session please reach out to me preferably 24 hours in advance.
* If most of the party is present then the players would be given a choice to either continue playing the session as planned or wait until the next session when the missing player would be able to play their character.
* If half of the party will be absent, then the session will be canceled.
* If you're going to be absent during a session, you can decided whether you want another player to play your character or be in the background.
* If I need to cancel a session, I will reach out to you the day before the session and if not sooner.

## Player Expectations

As a player you must,

* Not make a character designed to mess with the party and/or the DM
* Be respectful to everyone's ideas and beliefs
* Not use foul and offensive language
* Respect the DM's rulings when it comes to game play and not spend half a session arguing about how water flows

## DM Expectations 

As a DM I will,

* Listen to advice and suggestions of my players.  
* Not make a decision about your characters without your consent 
* Endorse player's using creativity to solve problems, even if it slightly bends the rules
* Not, I repeat this to myself I WILL NOT, take my anger out on my NPCs and/or PCs when someone does something extremely rage inducing (Still feel really bad about that... Sorry to that poor, innocent Tabaxi player)

## COVID Rules

* If we do decide to meet in person during the pandemic, masks WILL be required.
* If you do not want to wear a mask, I'll be happy to conduct a hybrid session (virtual/in person session).
* If you're not feeling well or have been exposed to COVID, stay home.

## D&D House Rules

* Ties for AC vs hit and spell vs spell save will always go to the attacker.
* Drinking a potion for yourself or tossing a potion (checks will be rolled) to another player is a bonus action. Administering a potion to another player costs an action.
* When using your inspiration, you can re-roll any roll (attack, damage, etc.) except death saving throws.
* Both half damage and half movement will be rounded up.
* Critical hits deal max damage plus damage roll plus modifiers.
