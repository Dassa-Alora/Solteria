# Social Contract

This social contract is a living document and more information can be added on at anytime.

## Session date and time

The sessions for the Solteria Campaign will take place weekly on Wednesday evenings from 8:30 PM to about 10:30 PM.

## Absences
* If you know you will be unable to attend a session please reach out to me, preferably 24 hours in advance.
* If only one party member is absent, we will continue to run the session as is (unless all party members are needed in that session).
* If two members of the party will be absent, then the session will be canceled.
* If you're going to be absent during a session, you can decided whether you want another player to run your character or be in the background.
* If I need to cancel a session, I will reach out to you the day before the session and if not sooner.

## Player Expectations

As a player you must,

* Not make a character designed to mess with the party and/or the DM
* Be respectful to everyone's ideas and beliefs
* Not use excessive foul and offensive language
* Respect the DM's rulings when it comes to game play and not spend half a session arguing about how water flows

## DM Expectations 

As a DM I will,

* Listen to advice and suggestions of my players.  
* Not make a decision about your characters without your consent 
* Endorse players using creativity to solve problems, even if it slightly bends the rules
* Not, I repeat this to myself I WILL NOT, take my anger out on my NPCs and/or PCs when someone does something extremely rage inducing (Still feel really bad about that... Sorry to that poor, innocent Tabaxi player)

## Hard Limits

We will not incorporate the following subjects into this campaign (this includes backstories).

* Rape, incest, sexual assault/violence, misogynistic language, and other such sensitive sexual topics
* Suicide, Suicidal thoughts/ideation
* Excessive violence against children and babies

## D&D House Rules

* Ties for AC vs hit and spell vs spell save will always go to the attacker.
* Drinking a potion for yourself or tossing a potion (checks will be rolled) to another player is a bonus action. Administering a potion to another player costs an action.
* When using your inspiration, you can re-roll any roll (attack, checks, damage, etc.) except death saving throws.
* Both half damage and half movement will be rounded up.
* Critical hits deal max damage plus damage roll plus modifiers.
